## Module Overview

A **digital twin** is a virtual replica of a physical robot that mirrors its behavior, sensors, and environment. Before deploying expensive hardware or risking safety issues, digital twins enable you to:

- **Test algorithms** in realistic simulated environments
- **Train machine learning models** with synthetic data
- **Debug complex behaviors** without physical hardware
- **Validate designs** before manufacturing

This module teaches you to build digital twins using two powerful simulation platforms:
- **Gazebo**: Open-source physics simulator with ROS 2 integration
- **Unity**: Game engine for photorealistic sensor simulation

## Why Digital Twins?

- **Cost-Effective**: Test ideas without buying hardware
- **Safe**: No risk of damaging robots or harming people
- **Scalable**: Run thousands of simulations in parallel
- **Reproducible**: Exact conditions for debugging and research
- **Faster Iteration**: Changes take seconds, not hours

## Module Structure

### Week 6: Gazebo Simulation
- Setting up Gazebo with ROS 2 integration
- Creating world files with physics properties
- Adding sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMU, force/torque)
- Spawning robots and controlling them via ROS 2 topics
- Debugging simulation vs. reality gaps

### Week 7: Unity for Photorealistic Simulation
- Unity Robotics Hub setup and ROS-TCP connector
- Importing robot models (URDF to Unity)
- Photorealistic camera simulation with ray tracing
- Sensor fusion (RGB-D cameras, semantic segmentation)
- Comparing Gazebo vs. Unity for different use cases

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

✅ **Build Gazebo worlds**: Create custom environments with terrain, obstacles, and lighting
✅ **Simulate sensors**: Configure cameras, LiDAR, and IMUs with realistic noise models
✅ **Bridge sim-to-real**: Transfer algorithms from simulation to physical robots
✅ **Choose the right tool**: Understand when to use Gazebo vs. Unity vs. Isaac Sim
✅ **Generate synthetic data**: Create labeled datasets for machine learning

## Capstone Integration

**How this module contributes to your autonomous humanoid project:**

Your capstone's **Navigation** component will be tested first in simulation:

1. **Gazebo** will simulate the humanoid walking through an office environment
2. **Unity** will provide photorealistic camera feeds for object detection testing
3. **Sim-to-real transfer** will validate that navigation works on physical hardware

Without digital twin skills, testing navigation would require expensive hardware and be time-consuming. Simulation enables rapid prototyping of navigation strategies.

## Time Commitment

- **Lectures & Reading**: 2 hours/week
- **Hands-On Exercises**: 2 hours/week
- **Gazebo Simulation Project**: 8 hours (Week 7)
- **Total**: ~16 hours across 2 weeks

## Assessment

**Gazebo Simulation Project** (Week 7):
Create a simulated environment with a robot navigating obstacles using sensor data. Detailed rubric coming soon.

## Gazebo vs. Unity vs. Isaac Sim

| Feature | Gazebo | Unity | Isaac Sim |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Physics** | ODE, Bullet, Dart | PhysX | PhysX (GPU-accelerated) |
| **ROS Integration** | Native | ROS-TCP Connector | Native ROS 2 |
| **Graphics** | Basic | Photorealistic | Photorealistic + RTX |
| **Best For** | Rapid prototyping | Synthetic data generation | Large-scale RL training |
| **License** | Open-source | Free (personal) | Free (with NVIDIA GPU) |

**Module 3** will introduce Isaac Sim, which combines the best of both worlds for GPU-accelerated robotics.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Module 1**: Ensure you understand ROS 2 publishers/subscribers
2. **Install Gazebo**: Follow setup guide for Gazebo 11 or Gazebo Fortress
3. **Start Week 6**: Gazebo Simulation Fundamentals *(Coming Soon)*
