# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

<LearningObjectives objectives={frontMatter.learning_objectives} />

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook - a comprehensive 13-week course designed for industry practitioners with programming experience.

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and manipulate the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital spaces, Physical AI combines:

- **Perception**: Understanding the environment through sensors (cameras, LiDAR, force sensors)
- **Planning**: Reasoning about actions and their consequences in physical space
- **Action**: Executing precise movements through actuators and motors
- **Learning**: Adapting behavior based on physical interactions

## Course Overview

This 13-week journey will take you from ROS 2 fundamentals to deploying autonomous humanoid robots capable of voice-driven manipulation tasks.

### Weeks 1-2: Foundations
- Introduction to Physical AI concepts
- Hardware setup (3 paths: Workstation, Edge Kit, Cloud)
- Development environment configuration

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (Weeks 3-5)
Learn **ROS 2** - the middleware that enables distributed robotic systems. Master nodes, topics, services, and URDF robot models.

### Module 2: Digital Twins (Weeks 6-7)
Build simulation environments using **Gazebo** and **Unity**. Test algorithms safely before deploying to physical hardware.

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac (Weeks 8-10)
Leverage **Isaac Sim** for GPU-accelerated robotics. Implement VSLAM, Nav2 navigation, and reinforcement learning.

### Module 4: VLA & Humanoids (Weeks 11-13)
Integrate **Vision-Language-Action models** with humanoid robots. Master kinematics, manipulation, and conversational AI.

### Week 13: Capstone Project
Build an autonomous humanoid system with the complete pipeline:
**Voice Input → Plan → Navigate → Perceive → Manipulate**

## Who This Course Is For

- **Industry practitioners** looking to transition into robotics
- **Software engineers** with Python experience
- **Researchers** wanting hands-on robotics skills
- **Hobbyists** committed to a structured learning path

### Prerequisites
- Proficiency in **Python** programming
- Comfort with Linux/Ubuntu command line
- Basic understanding of linear algebra (vectors, matrices)
- 10-12 hours per week for 13 weeks

## Learning Approach

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:

1. **Learning Objectives**: What you'll be able to do after this chapter
2. **Prerequisites**: Required prior knowledge
3. **Content**: Concepts, examples, and explanations
4. **Hands-On Exercises**: Apply what you've learned
5. **Summary**: Key takeaways
6. **References**: Further reading and resources

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your hardware path**: [Workstation](./setup/workstation), [Edge Kit](./setup/edge-kit), or [Cloud](./setup/cloud)
2. **Review the glossary**: [Glossary](./references/glossary) for robotics terminology
3. **Start Module 1**: [ROS 2 Architecture](./module-1-ros2)

## Assessment Structure

Your learning will be validated through:

- **ROS 2 Package Project** (Week 5): Build a multi-node robotic system
- **Gazebo Simulation** (Week 7): Create a simulated environment
- **Isaac Perception Pipeline** (Week 10): Implement VSLAM and navigation
- **Capstone Project** (Week 13): End-to-end autonomous humanoid system

Each assessment includes detailed rubrics with three evaluation levels: Needs Improvement, Proficient, and Excellent.

## Support and Resources

- **Glossary**: [Robotics Terminology](./references/glossary) for quick term lookup
- **Setup Guides**: [Workstation](./setup/workstation), [Edge Kit](./setup/edge-kit), [Cloud](./setup/cloud)
