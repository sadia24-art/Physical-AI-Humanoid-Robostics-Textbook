## Module Overview

**NVIDIA Isaac Sim** is a GPU-accelerated robotics simulator built on NVIDIA Omniverse. It combines:

- **Photorealistic rendering**: RTX ray tracing for synthetic sensor data
- **Physics simulation**: PhysX 5 with GPU acceleration for massive parallelism
- **ROS 2 integration**: Native bridges for seamless ROS 2 workflows
- **Reinforcement learning**: Isaac Gym for training thousands of agents in parallel

This module focuses on two critical robotic capabilities:
1. **Perception**: Using cameras and sensors to understand the environment (VSLAM)
2. **Navigation**: Planning paths and avoiding obstacles (Nav2 stack)

## Why Isaac Sim?

Compared to Gazebo and Unity (Module 2), Isaac Sim offers:

| Capability | Advantage |
|------------|-----------|
| **GPU Acceleration** | 10-100x faster than CPU-based simulation |
| **Synthetic Data** | Generate millions of labeled images for ML training |
| **Massive Parallelism** | Train RL policies with 10,000+ parallel environments |
| **RTX Rendering** | Photorealistic sensors for sim-to-real transfer |
| **Domain Randomization** | Automatic variation for robust real-world deployment |

## Module Structure

### Week 8: Isaac Sim Setup & Environment
- Installing Isaac Sim and system requirements (RTX GPU, Ubuntu 22.04)
- Creating photorealistic environments with assets from Omniverse
- Importing robot URDF models and configuring sensors
- ROS 2 bridge setup for publishing camera and LiDAR data
- Performance optimization (LOD, culling, ray tracing settings)

### Week 9: Visual SLAM & ROS 2 Navigation
- Implementing Visual SLAM (ORB-SLAM3, RTAB-Map) for localization
- Building occupancy grid maps from sensor data
- Integrating Nav2 stack for path planning
- Configuring costmaps and recovery behaviors
- Testing dynamic obstacle avoidance

### Week 10: Reinforcement Learning with Isaac Gym
- Introduction to Isaac Gym for massively parallel RL
- Training robotic grasping policies (pick-and-place)
- Domain randomization for sim-to-real transfer
- Deploying trained policies to Isaac Sim robots
- Comparing RL vs. classical planning approaches

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

✅ **Set up Isaac Sim**: Install and configure with ROS 2 integration
✅ **Implement VSLAM**: Localize robots using visual odometry and loop closure
✅ **Deploy Nav2**: Plan collision-free paths in dynamic environments
✅ **Train RL policies**: Use Isaac Gym for parallel reinforcement learning
✅ **Optimize performance**: Tune rendering and physics for real-time simulation

## Capstone Integration

**How this module contributes to your autonomous humanoid project:**

This is where your capstone comes to life. Module 3 provides the core autonomous capabilities:

1. **Perception** (VSLAM): The humanoid will localize itself in an office environment
2. **Navigation** (Nav2): Plan paths from current location to target objects
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Train grasping policies for manipulation

Your final system will use:
- **Isaac Sim VSLAM** → Publishes to `/map` and `/robot_pose` topics
- **Nav2 Stack** → Subscribes to planning requests, publishes to `/cmd_vel`
- **RL Grasping Policy** → Trained in Isaac Gym, deployed for object manipulation

Without these perception and navigation skills, the humanoid cannot autonomously navigate or manipulate objects.

## Time Commitment

- **Lectures & Reading**: 2 hours/week
- **Hands-On Exercises**: 3 hours/week
- **Isaac Perception Project**: 12 hours (Week 10)
- **Total**: ~27 hours across 3 weeks

## Assessment

**Isaac Perception Pipeline Project** (Week 10):
Implement VSLAM + Nav2 for autonomous navigation in a simulated office environment. Detailed rubric coming soon.

## Hardware Requirements

Isaac Sim requires:
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 2060 or better (RTX 3080+ recommended)
- **RAM**: 32GB minimum (64GB for large environments)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 or Windows 10/11
- **Storage**: 50GB for Isaac Sim + assets

**Don't have an RTX GPU?** Use the [Cloud Setup Guide](../setup/cloud) for AWS/Azure options.

## Isaac Sim vs. Gazebo vs. Unity

| Use Case | Best Tool |
|----------|-----------|
| Quick prototyping | Gazebo |
| Synthetic data generation | Unity or Isaac Sim |
| Reinforcement learning | Isaac Sim (Isaac Gym) |
| Large-scale parallelism | Isaac Sim |
| Open-source requirements | Gazebo |

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Module 2**: Ensure you understand Gazebo simulation basics
2. **Verify Hardware**: Check RTX GPU requirements or setup cloud instance
3. **Install Isaac Sim**: Follow [Workstation Setup](../setup/workstation)
4. **Start Week 8**: Isaac Sim Environment Setup *(Coming Soon)*
