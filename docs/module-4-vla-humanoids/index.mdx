**Duration**: Weeks 11-13 | **Estimated Time**: 9 hours
**Prerequisites**: [Module 3: Isaac Sim](../module-3-isaac)

## Module Overview

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models** represent the cutting edge of embodied AI - systems that can:

1. **See**: Process visual information from cameras
2. **Understand**: Interpret natural language commands
3. **Act**: Execute physical actions in the real world

This module brings together everything you've learned:
- **ROS 2** (Module 1): Communication between VLA components
- **Simulation** (Module 2): Test humanoid behaviors safely
- **Perception & Navigation** (Module 3): Locate objects and plan paths
- **Humanoid Control** (Module 4): Execute manipulation tasks

## What are VLA Models?

Traditional robots require explicit programming for each task. VLA models learn from demonstration and can generalize to new scenarios:

**Traditional Approach**:
```
IF user says "pick up red cup" THEN:
  1. Detect red cup (hard-coded vision)
  2. Calculate grasp pose (hard-coded IK)
  3. Execute trajectory (pre-programmed)
```

**VLA Approach**:
```
User: "Can you hand me the red cup?"
VLA Model: [observes scene] → [plans actions] → [executes manipulation]
  - Understands "hand me" implies grasp + bring
  - Recognizes "red cup" from visual observation
  - Generates manipulation trajectory end-to-end
```

## Module Structure

### Week 11: Humanoid Kinematics & Control
- Forward kinematics for multi-DOF humanoid robots
- Inverse kinematics using analytical and numerical methods
- Jacobian-based velocity control for smooth motions
- Whole-body control for maintaining balance during manipulation
- ROS 2 control interfaces (ros2_control, MoveIt 2)

### Week 12: Manipulation Primitives
- Grasp planning and force closure analysis
- Pick-and-place pipeline (approach → grasp → lift → transport → place)
- Collision avoidance during manipulation
- Reactive behaviors (compliant control, force feedback)
- Integrating manipulation with navigation (mobile manipulation)

### Week 13: Conversational VLA Integration
- Speech-to-text for voice command recognition
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for intent understanding
- Grounding language in robot actions (task planning)
- Vision-language models for object recognition
- End-to-end VLA deployment (voice → plan → act)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

✅ **Solve humanoid kinematics**: Compute joint angles for desired end-effector poses
✅ **Implement manipulation**: Build robust pick-and-place systems
✅ **Integrate conversational AI**: Connect voice commands to robot actions
✅ **Deploy VLA systems**: Create end-to-end embodied AI applications
✅ **Understand trade-offs**: Compare learned VLA models vs. classical planning

## Capstone Integration

**This module IS your capstone!** Everything culminates in Week 13:

Your **Autonomous Humanoid System** will execute this pipeline:

```
Voice Input: "Please bring me the blue bottle from the table"
    ↓
[Speech-to-Text] → Transcription
    ↓
[LLM Task Planner] → Subtasks: navigate → locate → grasp → bring
    ↓
[Navigation] (Module 3) → Move to table
    ↓
[Perception] (Module 3) → Detect blue bottle via VSLAM
    ↓
[Manipulation] (Module 4) → IK + grasp planning → pick up bottle
    ↓
[Navigation] (Module 3) → Return to user
    ↓
[Manipulation] (Module 4) → Hand over bottle
```

This integration demonstrates how all course modules work together to build an autonomous humanoid system. Capstone project guide coming soon.

## Time Commitment

- **Lectures & Reading**: 2 hours/week
- **Hands-On Exercises**: 3 hours/week
- **Capstone Project**: 25 hours (Week 13)
- **Total**: ~40 hours across 3 weeks

## Assessment

**Capstone Project** (Week 13):
Build the complete autonomous humanoid system with voice-driven manipulation. This is the culminating assessment that demonstrates all course learning outcomes. Detailed rubric coming soon.

## VLA Model Architectures

Current state-of-the-art VLA models include:

- **RT-2** (Google): Vision-language-action model trained on web data + robotics
- **PaLM-E** (Google): Multimodal LLM grounded in embodied sensor data
- **Octo** (UC Berkeley): Open-source generalist robot policy
- **Mobile ALOHA** (Stanford): Bimanual manipulation with VLA integration

You'll learn to:
1. Use pre-trained VLA models (RT-2, Octo) for zero-shot generalization
2. Fine-tune models on custom manipulation tasks
3. Integrate VLA outputs with classical planners (hybrid approach)

## Humanoid Platforms

This course is **hardware-agnostic**, but examples use common platforms:

- **Simulation**: Humanoid models in Isaac Sim (no physical hardware required)
- **Physical Options** (optional):
  - **Unitree H1**: 35 DOF research humanoid
  - **TIAGo**: Mobile manipulator (if full humanoid unavailable)
  - **Custom Humanoid**: Any ROS 2-compatible platform

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Module 3**: Ensure you understand VSLAM and Nav2
2. **Review Linear Algebra**: Brush up on rotation matrices, homogeneous transforms
3. **Install MoveIt 2**: Follow [Workstation Setup](../setup/workstation)
4. **Start Week 11**: Humanoid Kinematics *(Coming Soon)*
