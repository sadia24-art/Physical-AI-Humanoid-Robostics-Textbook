  TUTORIAL STRUCTURE GUIDANCE
  ============================================================================

  Tutorials should follow this structure:
  1. Learning Objectives & Prerequisites (auto-displayed from frontmatter)
  2. Introduction - What you'll build/learn and why it matters
  3. Setup/Prerequisites - Tools, environment, starting point
  4. Step-by-Step Instructions - Numbered steps with explanations
  5. Verification/Testing - How to confirm success
  6. Key Takeaways - Summary of what was learned
  7. Next Steps - Related topics or advanced extensions

  TUTORIAL BEST PRACTICES:
  - Use numbered lists for sequential steps
  - Include code examples inline with explanations
  - Add screenshots or diagrams for complex steps
  - Provide expected outputs after each major step
  - Include troubleshooting tips in callouts
  - End with a working, testable result

<!-- INTRODUCTION: Explain what readers will build/learn and why it's valuable -->
## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn [specific skill/outcome]. By the end, you'll have [concrete deliverable or capability].

**Why this matters:** [1-2 sentences on real-world relevance or how this builds toward course goals]

<!-- SETUP: List required tools, software versions, starting files, or environment -->
## Prerequisites and Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Software:** [Tool name] version X.X or higher
- **Hardware:** [If applicable, e.g., "Robot kit with servo motors"]
- **Files:** [Download link or reference to starter code]
- **Knowledge:** Familiarity with [concepts from prerequisite chapters]

### Verify Your Environment

```bash
# Command to check tool installation
tool-name --version
# Expected output: vX.X.X
```

<!-- MAIN CONTENT: Step-by-step instructions with code, explanations, and outputs -->
## Step 1: [First Major Step]

<!-- Explain WHAT you're doing and WHY before showing HOW -->
Brief explanation of what this step accomplishes and how it fits into the overall goal.

### Instructions

1. [Detailed substep with command or action]
   ```python
   # Example code with inline comments
   import example_library

   # Create instance with specific parameters
   instance = example_library.Thing(param1='value')
   ```

2. [Next substep with expected output]
   ```bash
   $ command-to-run
   Expected output:
   Success: Operation completed
   ```

3. [Verification step]
   **Expected result:** You should see [specific outcome]. If not, check [common issue].

:::tip Troubleshooting
If you encounter [common error], try [solution]. This happens when [explanation].
:::

## Step 2: [Second Major Step]

Continue with clear, sequential steps. Each major step should:
- Have a clear purpose
- Build on previous steps
- Include verification points
- Provide context for why it's necessary

### Code Example with Explanation

```python
def example_function(parameter):
    """
    Explain what this function does at a high level.

    Args:
        parameter: What this parameter controls

    Returns:
        What the function produces
    """
    # Implementation details with comments
    result = parameter * 2
    return result
```

**Understanding the code:**
- Line 1-2: [Explain key concept]
- Line 3: [Explain decision or approach]
- Line 4: [Explain expected behavior]

:::info Why This Approach?
Explain the reasoning behind a particular implementation choice or alternative approaches that were rejected.
:::

## Step 3: [Testing and Validation]

Now that you've completed the implementation, let's verify everything works correctly.

### Run the Complete Example

```bash
# Final command to test everything together
python your_script.py --input test_data.txt
```

**Expected output:**
```
[Show complete expected output]
Process completed successfully
Results saved to: output/results.json
```

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] [Specific outcome 1 achieved]
- [ ] [Specific outcome 2 achieved]
- [ ] [No error messages in console]
- [ ] [Output matches expected format]
