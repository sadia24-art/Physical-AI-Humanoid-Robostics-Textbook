  CONCEPT STRUCTURE GUIDANCE
  ============================================================================

  Concept chapters should follow this structure:
  1. Learning Objectives & Prerequisites (auto-displayed from frontmatter)
  2. Introduction - What concept you're explaining and why it matters
  3. Core Explanation - Detailed explanation with diagrams, examples
  4. Examples and Applications - Concrete instances of the concept
  5. Common Misconceptions - Address typical misunderstandings
  6. Key Takeaways - Summary and connections to broader topics
  7. Further Reading - Deep dives and related concepts

  CONCEPT BEST PRACTICES:
  - Start with intuition before formalism
  - Use analogies to build understanding
  - Include diagrams, visualizations, or interactive demos
  - Provide multiple examples at different complexity levels
  - Connect theory to practical robotics applications
  - Use callouts to highlight important points or warnings
  - Avoid step-by-step instructions (use Tutorial template for that)
