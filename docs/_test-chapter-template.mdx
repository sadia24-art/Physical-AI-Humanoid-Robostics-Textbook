This is a test chapter to validate the chapter template system components.

## Component Test Results

If you can see the Learning Objectives and Prerequisites sections above with proper styling, the components are working correctly.

### Expected Behavior

1. **LearningObjectives Component:**
   - Should display a styled card with "Learning Objectives" heading
   - Should list all objectives from frontmatter with checkmark icons
   - Should use primary theme color for border and heading

2. **Prerequisites Component:**
   - Should display "Before You Begin" heading
   - Should show estimated time with clock emoji
   - Should list prerequisites as clickable links
   - Should use proper formatting and spacing

## Next Steps

After validating these components work:
- Delete this test file (it's marked as `draft: true`)
- Proceed to Phase 4: User Story 1 (Chapter Template Creation)
