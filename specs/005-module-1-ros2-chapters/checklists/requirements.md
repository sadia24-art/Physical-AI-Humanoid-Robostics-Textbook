- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec focuses on "what" students need to learn, not "how" to implement the chapters. ROS 2, Python, and URDF are mentioned as the subject matter being taught, not as implementation choices.

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate student learning goals and deliverable capabilities (e.g., "can diagram ROS 2 systems", "can write working nodes").

✅ **Non-technical accessibility**: While the subject matter is technical (robotics education), the spec is written for educational stakeholders (instructors, curriculum designers) without assuming deep technical background.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated with detailed content.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification markers**: The spec contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements are specific and actionable.

✅ **Testable requirements**: All 68 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-068) specify verifiable capabilities using "MUST" language with clear success conditions.

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 10 success criteria include specific metrics (time limits, percentages, counts) that can be objectively verified (e.g., "within 10 minutes", "90% of students", "10Hz update rate with less than 5% jitter").

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on student capabilities and learning outcomes rather than implementation details. They describe observable behaviors and measurable performance.

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each of 5 user stories includes multiple "Given-When-Then" scenarios totaling 18 acceptance criteria across all stories.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: Six edge cases are documented covering fault tolerance, high-frequency data, type mismatches, naming conflicts, validation, and distributed systems.

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes 14 topics with clear rationale for each exclusion, preventing scope creep.

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**: Both sections are comprehensive, covering external dependencies (ROS 2, Python), course dependencies (prerequisite coursework, future modules), and 10 key assumptions about student background and infrastructure.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Functional requirements mapped to acceptance criteria**: The 68 functional requirements are organized by chapter (5 chapters) and can be directly traced to the user stories. Each user story focuses on a specific chapter's learning objectives.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: The 5 prioritized user stories (P1-P5) represent the complete learning journey from foundational concepts to operational excellence, with clear rationale for prioritization.

✅ **Measurable outcomes alignment**: The 10 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) directly align with the 6 learning objectives (LO-001 through LO-006) and map to the user stories.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: The spec maintains strict separation between educational content (what students learn about ROS 2) and implementation choices (how to author the chapters). References to technologies are appropriate as they're the subject matter being taught.

## Notes

- The specification is exceptionally detailed with 68 functional requirements across 5 chapters
- Strong focus on measurable learning outcomes with specific time and performance metrics
- Comprehensive risk analysis addresses technical, pedagogical, and content-related challenges
- Well-structured prioritization (P1-P5) enables flexible delivery based on time constraints
- Clear dependencies mapped between chapters and to other course modules
- Six open questions documented for instructor/curriculum designer decision-making

## Recommendation

**READY FOR NEXT PHASE**: This specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/sp.plan` to develop the implementation strategy for creating the Module 1 chapter content.
