# Feature Specification: Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Feature Branch**: `005-module-1-ros2-chapters`
**Created**: 2025-12-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "lets focus on writing module 1 chapters, here are content for all module, first do strong research only for module 1 chapters then write detailed specs for module 1 chapters"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-02

- Q: What is the primary assessment format for the end-of-module evaluation? → A: Individual practical assessment - Each student completes a coding challenge independently (e.g., create publisher/subscriber pair, service, launch file) within time limit to ensure individual skill mastery.
- Q: What level of code scaffolding should be provided to students for hands-on exercises? → A: Minimal scaffolding with TODOs - Provide skeleton files with imports, class structure, and TODO markers where students write core logic (callbacks, publishers, decision algorithms) to balance guidance with active learning.
- Q: Which ROS 2 distribution should Module 1 standardize on? → A: ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill (LTS) exclusively - LTS support until 2027 ensures curriculum longevity, stability, and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS compatibility for educational consistency.
- Q: What is the IDE policy for Module 1? → A: Recommend VS Code with ROS extensions, but allow alternatives - Install guides and screenshots use VS Code for consistency, but students may use vim/emacs/PyCharm if preferred. Students using alternatives are responsible for translating instructions.
- Q: Should Module 1 include any Gazebo simulation content? → A: Preview only in Chapter 4 URDF context - Brief instructor-led Gazebo demo (10-15 minutes) showing URDF loading and physics simulation to contextualize URDF learning. Students do not install or use Gazebo themselves in Module 1.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Understanding ROS 2 Architecture and Core Concepts (Priority: P1)

Students need to grasp the fundamental architecture of ROS 2 as a distributed middleware system before they can build robotic applications. They must understand how ROS 2 differs from ROS 1 (no master node, DDS-based communication) and comprehend the computational graph model where nodes communicate via topics, services, and actions.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational knowledge required for all subsequent learning. Without understanding nodes, topics, and services, students cannot progress to practical implementation or advanced concepts. This represents the minimum viable knowledge base for ROS 2 development.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students diagram a simple ROS 2 system (e.g., a robot with sensors and actuators), identify nodes, and explain the communication patterns between them. Delivers immediate value by enabling students to understand existing ROS 2 systems and documentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student reads Chapter 1 on ROS 2 Architecture, **When** they review the distributed architecture explanation with DDS middleware, **Then** they can explain why ROS 2 eliminates the single-point-of-failure master node and how nodes discover each other
2. **Given** a student completes the nodes/topics/services section, **When** presented with a robotics use case (e.g., sensor data collection), **Then** they can determine whether to use topics (continuous data streams) or services (request-response patterns)
3. **Given** a student studies the computational graph examples, **When** they examine a multi-node system diagram, **Then** they can identify publishers, subscribers, service clients, and service servers
4. **Given** a student learns about ROS 2 distributions (Humble, Iron), **When** they review compatibility requirements, **Then** they can select the appropriate distribution for their target platform (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)

---

### User Story 2 - Building ROS 2 Nodes with Python (rclpy) (Priority: P2)

Students need hands-on experience creating ROS 2 nodes using Python's rclpy library. They must learn to initialize nodes, create publishers and subscribers, implement service clients and servers, and manage node lifecycle. This includes understanding callback functions, quality of service (QoS) settings, and parameter management.

**Why this priority**: This is the first practical implementation step where students translate theoretical knowledge into working code. It's prioritized after P1 because students need conceptual understanding before writing code. This story delivers a working minimal node that can communicate within a ROS 2 system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students create a simple publisher node (e.g., sensor simulator) and subscriber node (e.g., data logger), run them together, and verify message exchange using ROS 2 CLI tools (ros2 topic echo). Delivers value by producing students' first functional ROS 2 application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student completes Chapter 2 on rclpy basics, **When** they write a minimal publisher node following the template, **Then** the node successfully publishes messages to a named topic at a specified rate
2. **Given** a student implements a subscriber node, **When** they run it alongside a publisher, **Then** the subscriber receives and processes messages using callback functions
3. **Given** a student creates a service server node, **When** a client node makes a service call, **Then** the server processes the request and returns the appropriate response
4. **Given** a student configures QoS policies (reliability, durability), **When** they test under simulated network conditions, **Then** they can observe and explain the impact of different QoS settings on message delivery
5. **Given** a student implements node parameters, **When** they launch the node with different parameter values, **Then** the node behavior changes accordingly without code modification

---

### User Story 3 - Bridging Python AI Agents to ROS 2 Controllers (Priority: P3)

Students need to integrate Python-based AI agents (e.g., decision-making algorithms, machine learning models) with ROS 2 control systems for humanoid robots. They must understand how to structure code that separates AI logic from ROS communication, use asynchronous programming patterns, and manage state between AI decision cycles and real-time control loops.

**Why this priority**: This bridges the gap between AI coursework from previous quarters and physical robotics. While important for the course's "Physical AI" theme, it builds upon P1 and P2 foundations. This story delivers the capability to control a robot using high-level AI decision-making.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students create an AI agent node (e.g., simple state machine or rule-based planner) that publishes velocity commands based on sensor input from subscriber callbacks. Delivers value by demonstrating AI-driven robot control in simulation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student completes Chapter 3 on AI-ROS integration, **When** they implement a Python agent class with decision logic, **Then** the agent can be instantiated within a ROS node and access sensor data via subscriptions
2. **Given** a student structures their code with separation of concerns, **When** they modify AI logic, **Then** the ROS communication layer remains unchanged and vice versa
3. **Given** a student implements a control loop with AI decision-making, **When** the node receives sensor data, **Then** the AI agent processes it and publishes control commands within acceptable latency (< 100ms for decision cycle)
4. **Given** a student uses action servers for long-running AI tasks, **When** the agent executes a multi-step behavior, **Then** the system provides feedback during execution and allows cancellation
5. **Given** a student tests AI-controller integration in simulation, **When** they deploy to a simulated humanoid (e.g., in Gazebo), **Then** the robot executes basic behaviors (e.g., walk forward, turn) based on AI commands

---

### User Story 4 - Understanding URDF for Humanoid Robot Description (Priority: P4)

Students need to understand URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) to define humanoid robot models for simulation and control. They must learn URDF syntax for links (robot body parts), joints (connections between parts), visual/collision geometry, inertial properties, and how to integrate sensor and actuator definitions for humanoid-specific components (torso, limbs, hands).

**Why this priority**: While essential for simulation work (Module 2), URDF knowledge can be introduced after students have working ROS 2 nodes. This story is lower priority for initial learning but critical before Module 2 (Gazebo simulation). Delivers the capability to define and visualize robot models.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students create a simplified humanoid URDF (e.g., stick figure with torso, arms, legs), visualize it in RViz2, and verify joint movements using the joint_state_publisher_gui tool. Delivers value by enabling students to represent robots in code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student reads Chapter 4 on URDF, **When** they create a basic URDF file with links and joints, **Then** the file parses without errors using check_urdf tool
2. **Given** a student defines visual and collision geometry, **When** they load the URDF in RViz2, **Then** the robot model displays correctly with proper proportions and colors
3. **Given** a student specifies joint types (revolute, prismatic) and limits, **When** they use joint_state_publisher_gui, **Then** joints move within specified ranges and degrees of freedom
4. **Given** a student adds inertial properties (mass, inertia tensor), **When** they load the model in a physics simulator, **Then** the robot behaves realistically under gravity and forces
5. **Given** a student creates a humanoid-specific URDF (head, torso, 2 arms, 2 legs), **When** they review best practices for humanoid kinematics, **Then** the joint hierarchy and reference frames follow conventions (e.g., right-hand rule, base_link as root)

---

### User Story 5 - Working with Launch Files and Package Management (Priority: P5)

Students need to manage complex ROS 2 systems with multiple nodes using launch files and organize code into reusable packages. They must learn to create launch files using Python syntax, pass parameters to nodes, configure remappings, and structure ROS 2 packages following standard conventions (package.xml, setup.py, directory structure).

**Why this priority**: This is operational excellence that improves productivity but isn't strictly required for initial learning. Students can manually launch individual nodes before learning launch files. However, this becomes essential for managing multi-node systems and team projects. Delivers professional development workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having students create a ROS 2 package containing multiple nodes (from P2) and a launch file that starts all nodes with appropriate parameters. Delivers value by enabling students to distribute and run complete robot systems with a single command.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a student reads Chapter 5 on launch files, **When** they create a Python launch file, **Then** it successfully starts multiple nodes with specified parameters and remappings
2. **Given** a student structures a ROS 2 package, **When** they run colcon build, **Then** the package compiles without errors and executables are accessible via ros2 run
3. **Given** a student defines package dependencies in package.xml, **When** they install the package on a new system, **Then** rosdep resolves and installs all required dependencies
4. **Given** a student uses launch file arguments, **When** they launch with different argument values, **Then** the system behavior changes (e.g., switching between simulation and real hardware)
5. **Given** a student creates a reusable package, **When** another student clones and builds it, **Then** it works without modification following ROS 2 conventions

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a node crashes mid-operation? How do other nodes handle loss of publishers/subscribers? Students should understand fault tolerance patterns and node lifecycle management.
- How does the system handle high-frequency sensor data (e.g., IMU at 100Hz, camera at 30fps)? Students should learn about message queue overflow, dropped messages, and QoS reliability settings.
- What occurs when message types mismatch between publisher and subscriber? Students should understand type safety in ROS 2 and the role of interface definitions.
- How are naming conflicts resolved when multiple nodes publish to the same topic? Students should learn about namespaces and topic remapping.
- What happens when URDF files contain invalid joint configurations (e.g., impossible inertia tensors)? Students should validate models before simulation.
- How does the system behave when running nodes across multiple machines with network latency? Students should understand DDS discovery and inter-machine communication.

## Assumptions *(optional)*

- Students have completed prior AI coursework including Python programming, basic algorithms, and introduction to machine learning
- Students have access to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS workstations (physical or VM) with at least 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores for ROS 2 development
- Students are familiar with command-line interfaces (bash, terminal navigation, text editors)
- Module 1 is delivered in weeks 3-5 of the quarter (3 weeks, approximately 9 contact hours)
- Each chapter requires approximately 2 hours of instruction plus 2-3 hours of hands-on lab work
- Students will use ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill (LTS release, supported until 2027) for consistency
- Assessment will be individual practical coding challenges (not team-based), ensuring each student demonstrates independent mastery of ROS 2 skills through timed exercises requiring creation of functional nodes, services, and launch files
- Code exercises use minimal scaffolding approach: skeleton files provide imports, class structure, and TODO markers where students implement core logic (callbacks, publishers, decision algorithms); this balances guidance with active learning and prevents copy-paste without understanding
- VS Code with ROS extensions is the recommended IDE for consistency in materials and support, but students may use alternative editors (vim, emacs, PyCharm) if they take responsibility for translating instructions to their chosen environment
- Students do not need physical robot hardware for Module 1; concepts are taught using CLI tools and basic visualization (RViz2)
- URDF work in Chapter 4 prepares for Gazebo simulation in Module 2 but does not require full simulation setup yet
- Integration with NVIDIA Isaac (Module 3) and VLA models (Module 4) will be addressed in later modules

## Dependencies *(optional)*

### External Dependencies

- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill distribution installed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

- Prepares for: Module 2 (Gazebo simulation requires URDF knowledge), Module 3 (Isaac ROS builds on ROS 2 fundamentals), Module 4 (VLA integration requires action server knowledge)

### Content Dependencies Between Chapters

- Chapter 2 depends on Chapter 1: Students must understand node/topic/service concepts before implementing them in code
- Chapter 3 depends on Chapters 1-2: AI-ROS integration requires working knowledge of publishers, subscribers, and actions
- Chapter 4 is relatively independent but benefits from Chapter 1: URDF learning enhanced by understanding how robot models integrate with ROS 2 system
- Chapter 5 depends on Chapters 1-2: Launch files and packages organize nodes learned in earlier chapters

## Out of Scope *(optional)*

### Explicitly Excluded from Module 1

- **Physical robot hardware**: Module 1 focuses on software foundations; physical deployment covered in later modules
- **Hands-on Gazebo simulation**: Students do not install or use Gazebo in Module 1; full physics simulation, world building, and sensor simulation deferred to Module 2 (Digital Twin). Note: Chapter 4 includes brief instructor-led Gazebo preview demo only.
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim/ROS**: Covered in Module 3 (AI-Robot Brain)
- **Computer vision and perception pipelines**: Covered in Module 3 with Isaac ROS
- **Navigation stack (Nav2)**: Covered in Module 3 for path planning
- **MoveIt2 motion planning**: Not covered in Module 1; may be introduced in Module 2 or 3 depending on scope
- **ros2_control framework**: Deferred to Module 2 when integrating with Gazebo simulation
- **TF2 transforms in depth**: Introduced conceptually in Chapter 3, detailed coverage in Module 2
- **Custom message/service definition**: Students use standard ROS 2 message types; custom interfaces deferred to advanced topics or capstone
- **Multi-robot systems**: Single robot focus; multi-agent coordination out of scope for Module 1
- **ROS 1 Bridge**: Course uses ROS 2 exclusively; no backwards compatibility with ROS 1
- **Real-time operating systems (RTOS)**: Standard Linux scheduling assumed; RTOS integration out of scope
- **Security and authentication**: DDS security plugins and SROS2 out of scope for introductory module
- **Performance optimization**: Basic performance awareness included, but profiling and optimization deferred to advanced topics

## Risks and Mitigations *(optional)*

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Students struggle with Linux/Ubuntu if coming from Windows/Mac backgrounds
  - **Mitigation**: Provide pre-configured VM images or cloud workspaces; include Linux command-line primer in pre-module materials

- **Risk**: ROS 2 installation issues across different hardware configurations
  - **Mitigation**: Standardize on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS + ROS 2 Humble; provide troubleshooting guide for common issues; use Docker containers as fallback

- **Risk**: Students overwhelmed by amount of new concepts (Linux, Python, ROS, robotics all at once)
  - **Mitigation**: Scaffold learning with very simple examples first (e.g., single publisher-subscriber before multi-node systems); provide reference code templates

### Pedagogical Risks

- **Risk**: Students treat ROS 2 as "black box" without understanding underlying concepts
  - **Mitigation**: Include conceptual explanations with visualizations before code examples; require students to diagram systems before implementing

- **Risk**: Wide variation in student Python skill levels
  - **Mitigation**: Provide Python refresher materials as pre-work; use pair programming in labs to balance skill levels; offer office hours for struggling students

- **Risk**: Students copy-paste code without understanding
  - **Mitigation**: Require students to modify working examples (change message types, add features) to demonstrate understanding; use code reviews and oral explanations in assessments

### Content Risks

- **Risk**: URDF chapter (Ch 4) feels disconnected from other chapters without simulation context
  - **Mitigation**: Include RViz2 visualization throughout; show how URDF integrates with robot_state_publisher node; preview Gazebo simulation from Module 2

- **Risk**: AI-ROS integration chapter (Ch 3) too abstract without concrete AI algorithms
  - **Mitigation**: Use very simple AI examples (finite state machine, PID controller) that students can fully understand; focus on integration patterns rather than complex AI

- **Risk**: Pace too fast for 3-week module with 5 substantial chapters
  - **Mitigation**: Chapter 5 (launch files/packages) can be compressed or partially covered; URDF depth can be adjusted based on time availability; priority system (P1-P5 user stories) allows flexibility

## Open Questions *(optional)*

1. **Hardware access**: Will students have access to edge compute devices (Jetson) during Module 1, or only in Module 3/4? Early access could motivate learning but may be logistically complex.
