# Tasks: Book Master Plan - Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-book-master-plan/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: This feature does not require traditional tests. Validation is done through build checks, link validation, and Lighthouse CI.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a **Docusaurus documentation site** with:
- `docs/` - main content directory
- `src/` - custom React components and pages
- `static/` - static assets (images, files)
- Configuration files at repository root: `docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipelines

---

- [x] T008 [P] Configure theme settings in docusaurus.config.js (colorMode, navbar with logo and items, footer with links)
- [x] T009 [P] Configure build settings in docusaurus.config.js (onBrokenLinks: 'throw', onBrokenMarkdownLinks: 'throw', SEO metadata, sitemap generation)
- [x] T010 Create sidebars.js with base structure for tutorialSidebar array
- [x] T011 [P] Create src/css/custom.css with CSS variables for theme colors and custom styles
- [x] T012 Create docs directory with subdirectories (setup/, module-1-ros2/, module-2-digital-twin/, module-3-isaac/, module-4-vla-humanoids/, capstone/, assessments/, references/, instructors/)
- [x] T013 Create static/img directory with subdirectories (intro/, module-1-ros2/, module-2-digital-twin/, module-3-isaac/, module-4-vla-humanoids/)
- [x] T014 [P] Setup metadata validation script using ajv library with chapter-metadata-schema.json in package.json scripts
- [x] T015 [P] Create .github/workflows/build-validation.yml for build checks and broken link validation using linkinator
- [x] T016 [P] Create .github/workflows/performance-check.yml for Lighthouse CI with thresholds (performance ≥ 90, accessibility ≥ 95, SEO ≥ 95)
- [x] T017 [P] Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml for GitHub Pages deployment (main branch only)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1) can start after Foundational → MVP target
  - User Story 2 (P1) can start after Foundational → Can run in parallel with US1
  - User Story 3 (P2) can start after US1/US2 (needs module structure)
  - User Story 4 (P2) can start after US1 (needs sidebar structure)
  - User Story 5 (P3) can start after US1 (needs sidebar structure)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- Module index pages can be created in parallel
- Setup guides can be created in parallel
- Assessment guides can be created in parallel
- Reference materials can be created in parallel

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002, T003, T004)
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T008, T009, T014, T015, T016, T017)
- User Story 1 and User Story 2 can run in parallel (both P1 priority, independent)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create src/components/ModuleCard.tsx React component"
Task: "Create src/components/QuickLinks.tsx React component"
Task: "Create src/components/RecentUpdates.tsx React component"

# Launch all module index pages for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create docs/module-1-ros2/index.md with module overview"
Task: "Create docs/module-2-digital-twin/index.md with module overview"
Task: "Create docs/module-3-isaac/index.md with module overview"
Task: "Create docs/module-4-vla-humanoids/index.md with module overview"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all setup guides for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Create docs/setup/workstation.md with Digital Twin Workstation setup guide"
Task: "Create docs/setup/edge-kit.md with Physical AI Edge Kit setup guide"
Task: "Create docs/setup/cloud.md with Cloud-Native Setup guide"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Navigate Complete Course Structure)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Access Foundational Setup Documentation)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 and US2 independently (homepage dashboard works, setup guides accessible, glossary searchable)
6. Deploy/demo if ready

**Rationale**: Both US1 and US2 are P1 priority and provide the foundational navigation and setup content needed for students to start the course.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 + User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Module learning paths)
4. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Assessments)
5. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Quick references)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Navigation)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Setup & Glossary)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Assessments) - can start after US1 sidebar is ready
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Success Criteria Mapping

Each success criterion from spec.md is satisfied by specific tasks:

- **SC-001** (2-click navigation): T021 (dashboard homepage), T023 (sidebar with nested categories)
- **SC-002** (95% links work): T015 (broken link checker), T072 (run link validation)
- **SC-003** (Module learning outcomes): T025-T028 (module index pages with learning_objectives)
- **SC-004** (3 hardware setups): T031-T033 (setup guides)
- **SC-005** (Capstone mapping): T044 (capstone guide with chapter mappings)
- **SC-006** (Time estimates): T046 (aggregate time estimates in module summaries)
- **SC-007** (100+ glossary terms): T035 (glossary.md), T036-T038 (glossary search component)
- **SC-008** (3-level rubrics): T048-T051 (assessment guides with rubrics)
- **SC-009** (Independent Week 1-2): T074 (test incremental publishing)
- **SC-010** (Prerequisite graph): T030 (cross-references), metadata schema includes prerequisites array

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Build validation (T071), link checking (T072), and Lighthouse CI (T073) serve as "tests" for this documentation project
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All chapter frontmatter must validate against contracts/chapter-metadata-schema.json
- Follow Constitution Principle III for consistent chapter structure template
