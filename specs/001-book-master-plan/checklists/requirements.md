# Specification Quality Checklist: Book Master Plan

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- Spec focuses on WHAT (book structure, modules, chapters) not HOW (Docusaurus specifics handled in separate spec)
- User scenarios focus on practitioner value (navigate, access, learn, assess)
- Requirements describe outcomes, not technologies
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- No clarification markers - all requirements are concrete based on course syllabus provided
- Each FR is specific and verifiable (e.g., "4 distinct modules", "3 hardware setup paths")
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (2 clicks, 95% links, 100 terms, 5 minutes)
- SC avoid implementation (e.g., "Students can locate..." not "Docusaurus sidebar shows...")
- 5 user stories with Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios
- 4 edge cases identified with resolution strategies
- Scope boundaries clearly separate book structure (in scope) from content creation (out of scope)
- Dependencies section lists constitution, course syllabus, hardware specs, Docusaurus
- Assumptions section documents student profile, duration, delivery method

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- Each FR maps to user scenarios and success criteria
- User scenarios cover complete student journey: navigate → setup → learn → assess → reference
- 10 success criteria provide comprehensive coverage of navigation, content, quality goals
- Spec remains at business/user level - technical decisions deferred to planning phase

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and focused on user value. All quality criteria pass. Ready to proceed to `/sp.plan` phase.

## Notes

- Book Master Plan defines structure only - individual chapter content will require separate specs
- Phased rollout strategy documented (Introduction → Modules → Capstone)
- Constitution compliance explicitly referenced in dependencies
- Consider creating visualization of prerequisite dependency graph during planning phase
