# Feature Specification: Chapter Template System

**Feature Branch**: `002-chapter-template-system`
**Created**: 2025-11-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a chapter template system for the Physical AI textbook that standardizes content structure across all 50+ chapters with MDX components, code block standards, callout guidelines, and automatic navigation"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create New Chapter from Template (Priority: P1)

As a content author, I need to create a new chapter using a standardized template so that all chapters have consistent structure and I don't have to remember the required sections.

**Why this priority**: Foundation for all content authoring. Without a template, authors will create inconsistent chapters, making the textbook harder to navigate and maintain.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by copying the template file, filling in chapter-specific content, and verifying all required sections are present with proper frontmatter metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a content author starts a new chapter, **When** they copy the chapter template to the appropriate module directory, **Then** the template includes all required frontmatter fields (title, description, keywords, sidebar_position, estimated_time, week, learning_objectives) and standard section headings (Introduction, Core Content, Hands-On Exercise, Key Takeaways, Summary, References)

2. **Given** a content author uses the chapter template, **When** they fill in the placeholder content, **Then** the chapter automatically inherits the correct structure including Learning Objectives box, Prerequisites callout, and navigation links

3. **Given** a chapter is created from the template, **When** the author builds the documentation site, **Then** the chapter appears in the correct sidebar position with proper metadata displayed

---

### User Story 2 - Display Learning Components (Priority: P1)

As a reader, I need to see learning objectives, prerequisites, and estimated time prominently displayed at the start of each chapter so I can determine if I'm ready to learn this content.

**Why this priority**: Critical for self-paced learning. Readers need to know what they'll learn and what prior knowledge is required before investing time in a chapter.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening any chapter and verifying that Learning Objectives, Prerequisites, and Estimated Time are visible above the main content (not just in frontmatter metadata).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader opens a chapter, **When** the page loads, **Then** a Learning Objectives box appears near the top showing all objectives from frontmatter as a bulleted list with an icon

2. **Given** a reader views a chapter, **When** prerequisites exist in frontmatter, **Then** a Prerequisites callout displays linked chapter names and estimated completion time

3. **Given** a chapter has estimated_time in frontmatter, **When** the page renders, **Then** a time badge displays "⏱️ Estimated Time: X hours" in the chapter header or prerequisites section

---

### User Story 3 - Add Code Examples with Standards (Priority: P2)

As a content author, I need to include code examples that automatically have syntax highlighting, line numbers, copy buttons, and line highlighting so readers can easily understand and reproduce the code.

**Why this priority**: Code examples are central to a technical textbook. Proper formatting makes them readable and usable. This is P2 because authors can manually add some features, but standardization ensures consistency.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a code block to a chapter using the documented syntax and verifying that syntax highlighting, line numbers, copy button, and line highlighting render correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a content author adds a code block with language specified (e.g., ```python), **When** the page renders, **Then** the code has syntax highlighting for that language and a copy-to-clipboard button appears in the top-right corner

2. **Given** a content author adds `showLineNumbers` to a code block, **When** the page renders, **Then** line numbers appear on the left side of the code block

3. **Given** a content author adds line highlighting syntax `{1,4-6}` to a code block, **When** the page renders, **Then** the specified lines are highlighted with a background color to draw attention

4. **Given** a content author adds `title="filename.py"` to a code block, **When** the page renders, **Then** the filename appears as a header above the code block

---

### User Story 4 - Use Callouts for Important Information (Priority: P2)

As a content author, I need to use callouts (admonitions) to highlight notes, tips, warnings, and dangerous information so readers can quickly identify important context.

**Why this priority**: Callouts improve readability and help readers avoid common pitfalls. This is P2 because content can be written without them, but they significantly enhance comprehension.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding each callout type (note, tip, warning, danger, info) to a chapter and verifying correct styling and icons render.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a content author adds `:::note` with content, **When** the page renders, **Then** a blue-styled callout with an info icon displays the content

2. **Given** a content author adds `:::tip[Custom Title]` with content, **When** the page renders, **Then** a green-styled callout with a lightbulb icon and "Custom Title" header displays the content

3. **Given** a content author adds `:::warning` or `:::danger` with content, **When** the page renders, **Then** orange or red-styled callouts with appropriate icons display to indicate severity

4. **Given** a content author nests callouts (e.g., tip inside note), **When** the page renders, **Then** the nested structure displays correctly with proper indentation

---

### User Story 5 - Navigate Between Chapters (Priority: P3)

As a reader, I need automatic previous/next navigation links at the bottom of each chapter so I can easily progress through the course sequentially.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience but not critical for MVP. Readers can use sidebar navigation as a fallback. This is P3 because it's a polish feature.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to any chapter and verifying that "Previous" and "Next" links appear at the bottom, correctly linking to adjacent chapters in the sidebar order.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader finishes a chapter (not the first chapter), **When** they scroll to the bottom, **Then** a "← Previous: [Chapter Title]" link appears on the left

2. **Given** a reader finishes a chapter (not the last chapter), **When** they scroll to the bottom, **Then** a "Next: [Chapter Title] →" link appears on the right

3. **Given** a reader is on the first chapter of a module, **When** they scroll to the bottom, **Then** no "Previous" link appears, only "Next"

---

### User Story 6 - Summarize Key Takeaways (Priority: P2)

As a reader, I need a Key Takeaways summary at the end of each chapter so I can review the most important concepts before moving on.

**Why this priority**: Reinforces learning and aids retention. This is P2 because it's important for pedagogical effectiveness but not blocking content creation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a Key Takeaways component to a chapter and verifying it renders as a visually distinct callout with summary points.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a content author adds a `<KeyTakeaways>` component with bulleted content, **When** the page renders, **Then** a styled box with a checkmark icon displays the takeaways near the end of the chapter

2. **Given** a chapter has a Key Takeaways section, **When** a reader views it, **Then** the section stands out visually from regular content (e.g., background color, border, icon)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a chapter has no prerequisites? (Prerequisites callout should not display)
- What happens when estimated_time is 0 or missing? (Display validation warning or default message)
- What happens when learning_objectives array is empty? (Display validation error - this is required)
- How does the system handle chapters with extremely long code blocks (>100 lines)? (Line numbers and copy button should still work; consider pagination or collapse)
- What happens when an author forgets to close a callout with `:::`? (Build should fail with clear error message)
- What happens when a chapter is the only one in a module? (No prev/next links, or link to module index)
- How does the system handle code blocks with special characters that might break syntax highlighting? (Escape characters properly; provide troubleshooting guidance)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Chapter template MUST include a Markdown file (`.md` or `.mdx`) located in `.specify/templates/chapter-template.md` with all required frontmatter fields (title, description, keywords, sidebar_position, estimated_time, week, learning_objectives) and standard section headings

- **FR-002**: Chapter template MUST be a single file with inline comments that define guidance for four content type variants: Tutorial (step-by-step, goal-oriented), Concept (explanatory, theory-focused), Hands-on Lab (applied exercise), and Reference (lookup, quick reference). Comments explain which sections are required/optional/emphasized for each type.

- **FR-003**: Learning Objectives component MUST display frontmatter `learning_objectives` array as a visible callout box (not just metadata) with a distinctive icon and heading "Learning Objectives"

- **FR-010**: Key Takeaways component MUST display a visually distinct summary box (e.g., background color, border, icon) containing bulleted key points at the end of each chapter

- **FR-011**: Navigation MUST include automatic previous/next chapter links at the bottom of each page, generated from sidebar configuration

- **FR-012**: Navigation links MUST display adjacent chapter titles (not just "Previous"/"Next") to provide context

- **FR-013**: Chapter structure MUST follow this standard order:
  1. Frontmatter (YAML)

- **FR-015**: Template MUST include inline comments explaining how to use each component and when to apply each content type variant

- **FR-016**: All chapters created from template MUST validate against chapter metadata JSON Schema (`contracts/chapter-metadata-schema.json`) during the build process (`npm run build`). Build MUST fail with clear error messages if any chapter has invalid metadata.

- **FR-017**: Content style guide MUST define:
  - When to use each content type (Tutorial vs. Concept vs. Hands-on Lab vs. Reference)
  - How to write learning objectives using Bloom's taxonomy action verbs (Explain, Create, Implement, Analyze, Evaluate, Design, Debug, Configure, Demonstrate, Compare, Apply)
  - Code comment style and variable naming conventions
  - Voice and tone guidelines (active voice, second person "you", present tense)

### Key Entities

- **Chapter Template**: Markdown file defining structure, frontmatter fields, section headings, and component usage examples. Serves as the blueprint for all new chapters.

- **Learning Objectives Component**: MDX React component that reads `learning_objectives` from frontmatter and renders them as a styled callout box with list items.

- **Prerequisites Component**: MDX React component that reads `prerequisites` array from frontmatter, generates links to prerequisite chapters, and displays with estimated time.

- **Key Takeaways Component**: MDX React component that wraps summary content in a visually distinct box with checkmark icon and styling.

- **Exercise Block Component**: MDX React component with props for title, difficulty, problem statement, starter code, hints (array), and solution. Supports collapsible sections.

- **Content Type Variant**: Classification for chapters (Tutorial, Concept, Hands-on Lab, Reference) with associated structural guidance and examples.

- **Code Block Enhancement**: Configuration and documentation for Docusaurus code block features including syntax highlighting, line numbers, line highlighting, titles, and copy buttons.

- **Callout (Admonition)**: Docusaurus built-in feature with five types (note, tip, warning, danger, info), each with distinct styling, icons, and use case guidance.

- **Navigation Configuration**: Docusaurus theme configuration enabling automatic prev/next links at chapter bottom based on sidebar structure.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Content authors can create a new chapter from template to first draft in under 30 minutes (excluding content writing time), including all required frontmatter and standard sections

- **SC-002**: 100% of chapters created from template pass metadata validation against JSON Schema during build without errors (validation runs automatically in `npm run build`)

- **SC-003**: All code examples across the textbook have consistent formatting (syntax highlighting, copy buttons) without requiring manual styling from authors

- **SC-004**: Readers can identify learning objectives, prerequisites, and estimated time within 5 seconds of opening any chapter (visible above-the-fold, not in frontmatter)

- **SC-005**: Key information (warnings, tips, notes) is highlighted in 90% of chapters using callouts, improving scanability compared to plain text

- **SC-006**: Readers can navigate sequentially through the course using prev/next links in 100% of chapters (except first/last)

- **SC-007**: All chapters follow the same structural order, making the textbook predictable and easier to navigate

- **SC-008**: Content authors report (via survey) that the template system reduces chapter creation time by at least 40% compared to creating chapters from scratch

- **SC-009**: Zero build failures related to malformed callouts, code blocks, components, or invalid metadata after authors use the template and follow guidelines (includes automatic metadata validation in build)

- **SC-010**: Readers can distinguish between content types (Tutorial vs. Concept vs. Hands-on Lab) based on visual structure and headings

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- Docusaurus 3.x is already installed and configured as the documentation framework
- MDX (Markdown + JSX) is enabled in Docusaurus configuration, allowing React components in Markdown files
- Chapter metadata JSON Schema exists at `specs/001-book-master-plan/contracts/chapter-metadata-schema.json`
- Content authors have basic Markdown knowledge and can follow template examples
- Readers access the textbook via a web browser (not PDF or print in MVP)
- Sidebar configuration (`sidebars.js`) is maintained separately and updated when new chapters are added
- Template will be stored in `.specify/templates/` directory for easy access
- Content authors will manually copy the template to create new chapters (no automated scaffolding script in MVP)
- Navigation links will use Docusaurus built-in theme components (no custom implementation required)
- Code syntax highlighting languages are already supported by Docusaurus (Prism.js) without additional configuration
- Content style guide will be a separate Markdown document (not embedded in template)
- Exercise block solutions are text/code only (no automated validation or testing in MVP)
- Exercise block "attempt tracking" for hint reveals is client-side state management only (e.g., user clicks "Submit" button, which unlocks next hint) without server-side persistence or correctness validation

## Out of Scope *(mandatory)*

- Automated chapter generation or AI-assisted content writing
- Interactive code execution (live REPL/sandbox for running Python/ROS 2 code)
- Automated grading or validation of exercise solutions
- Quiz components with multiple-choice questions (deferred to `003-learning-components`)
- Video embed components (deferred to `003-learning-components`)
- Interactive diagrams or Mermaid integration (deferred to `003-learning-components`)
- Progress tracking or completion status per chapter (deferred to future feature)
- Print stylesheet or PDF export optimization (deferred to `004-visual-design-system`)
- Custom typography or color palette (deferred to `004-visual-design-system`)
- Multi-language support or internationalization (i18n)
- Versioning for different course editions (Docusaurus supports this but not in scope for MVP)
- Search configuration or Algolia integration (separate feature)
- Mobile-responsive design beyond Docusaurus defaults (deferred to `004-visual-design-system`)
- Accessibility enhancements beyond Docusaurus built-in support (ARIA labels, screen reader optimization)

## Dependencies *(mandatory)*

- **Docusaurus 3.x**: Chapter template relies on Docusaurus MDX support, theme components, and configuration
- **Existing Frontmatter Schema**: Template must align with `chapter-metadata-schema.json` (9 required fields)
- **Sidebar Configuration**: Navigation links depend on chapters being correctly registered in `sidebars.js`
- **MDX Components**: Learning Objectives, Prerequisites, Key Takeaways, and Exercise Block components must be created in `src/components/` before template can reference them
- **Book Layout Audit**: Template design is based on findings and recommendations in `specs/001-book-master-plan/book-layout-audit.md`

## Constraints *(mandatory)*

- Template must be technology-agnostic in presentation (no framework-specific jargon in content)
- All components must work with static site generation (no client-side-only features that break SSR)
- File size of template must be under 5KB to ensure fast copying and editing
- Template must not require content authors to write React/TypeScript code (components are imported, not implemented)
- Navigation links must work with nested sidebar categories (multi-level hierarchy)
- Code blocks must not exceed Docusaurus default limits (no known hard limit, but >1000 lines may cause performance issues)
- Callouts must render correctly in both light and dark modes
- All components must be accessible (keyboard navigable, screen reader compatible)
- Template structure must be maintainable by a single person (no complex build scripts or tooling)

## Risks *(optional)*

- **Risk**: Content authors may not follow the template consistently, leading to structural drift over time
  - **Mitigation**: Provide clear inline comments in template; create validation script to check chapter structure; conduct author training/onboarding

- **Risk**: MDX component imports may break if components are moved or renamed
  - **Mitigation**: Use aliased imports (e.g., `@site/src/components/`) to decouple from exact paths; document import syntax clearly

- **Risk**: Overuse of callouts may reduce their effectiveness (alert fatigue)
  - **Mitigation**: Provide usage guidelines specifying when each callout type is appropriate; review chapters for overuse during editing

- **Risk**: Navigation links may break if sidebar configuration is restructured
  - **Mitigation**: Use Docusaurus automatic navigation generation (theme feature); test navigation after sidebar changes

- **Risk**: Code blocks with very long lines may cause horizontal scrolling, hurting readability
  - **Mitigation**: Provide code formatting guidelines (max 80-100 characters per line); configure Docusaurus to wrap long lines

## Related Features *(optional)*

- **001-book-master-plan**: This feature implements the #1 priority recommendation from the book layout audit
- **003-learning-components** (future): Will add interactive elements (quizzes, code playgrounds) that complement the template structure
- **004-visual-design-system** (future): Will refine visual styling of template components (typography, colors, spacing)

## Clarifications *(optional)*

### Session 2025-11-30

- Q: How should Exercise Block progressive hints be revealed to learners? → A: Attempt-based reveal - hints unlock after users try submitting code/answer (requires tracking)
- Q: Should content type variants (Tutorial, Concept, Hands-on Lab, Reference) have separate template files or be part of one template? → A: Single template with conditional comments explaining which sections apply to which content type
- Q: When should chapter metadata validation against JSON Schema occur in the authoring workflow? → A: On build - validation runs during `npm run build` as a pre-deployment check
