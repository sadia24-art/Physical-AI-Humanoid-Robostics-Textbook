# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter Template System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Spec avoids implementation specifics (e.g., doesn't prescribe React implementation details, focuses on component behavior)
- ✅ User stories are written from content author and reader perspectives
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-developers (explains "callouts," "frontmatter," etc.)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Out of Scope, Dependencies, Constraints

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in spec
- ✅ Each FR is testable (e.g., "MUST include frontmatter fields," "MUST display as visible callout")
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics (e.g., "under 30 minutes," "100% of chapters," "within 5 seconds")
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "readers can identify learning objectives" vs. "React component renders")
- ✅ Each user story has 1-4 acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Edge cases section includes 7 scenarios covering missing data, malformed input, and boundary conditions
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly excludes interactive code execution, quizzes, video embeds, etc.
- ✅ Dependencies section lists Docusaurus 3.x, frontmatter schema, sidebar config, MDX components, book layout audit
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 12 reasonable defaults (e.g., Docusaurus installed, MDX enabled, web browser access)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Each of 17 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-017) specifies MUST criteria that can be tested
- ✅ 6 user stories cover: template creation, learning component display, code examples, callouts, navigation, key takeaways
- ✅ 10 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) align with user stories and FRs
- ✅ Spec maintains technology-agnostic language throughout (e.g., "component" not "React component," "callout" not "admonition div")

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Specification is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`

**Summary**:
This specification is complete, testable, and focused on user value. It clearly defines what content authors and readers need without prescribing implementation details. All 17 functional requirements are unambiguous and can be independently verified. The 10 success criteria provide measurable outcomes that can validate feature success. No clarifications are needed—all decisions are well-informed with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions.

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive user stories covering both content authors (creators) and readers (consumers)
- Clear prioritization (P1, P2, P3) enabling incremental delivery
- Detailed edge case analysis anticipating real-world scenarios
- Explicit scope boundaries (Out of Scope section prevents feature creep)
- Strong traceability between user stories, FRs, and success criteria

**Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/sp.clarify` if any ambiguities emerge during team review (none currently identified)
2. OR proceed directly to `/sp.plan` to design implementation approach
3. Use this spec as acceptance criteria during development and testing

## Notes

No issues found during validation. Specification meets all quality criteria on first pass.
