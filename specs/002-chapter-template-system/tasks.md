# Tasks: Chapter Template System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-chapter-template-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: No formal test tasks included per specification - validation occurs via build-time schema validation and manual testing.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a Docusaurus web application project:
- Components: `src/components/`
- Theme overrides: `src/theme/`
- Styles: `src/css/`
- Scripts: `scripts/`
- Templates: `.specify/templates/`
- Documentation: `docs/references/`
- Contracts: `specs/002-chapter-template-system/contracts/` (design docs)

---

## Phase 8: User Story 5 - Navigate Between Chapters (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Readers can navigate sequentially using automatic prev/next links at chapter bottom

**Independent Test**: Navigate to any chapter and verify prev/next links appear correctly with adjacent chapter titles

- [ ] T052 [US5] Test prev/next navigation by creating a multi-chapter sequence in docs/test/

**Checkpoint**: Navigation functional and documented

---

## Phase 9: Migration - Apply Template System to Existing Chapters

**Purpose**: Migrate existing 9 chapter files to use the new template system components

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This phase applies the template system infrastructure to actual content so readers see the upgraded layout

### Migration for Existing Chapters

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US2+US1 → US6 → US3 → US4 → US5)
- **Migration (Phase 9)**: Depends on US2 completion (components must exist) - CRITICAL for visible upgrade
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 2 (P1) - Phase 3**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 1 (P1) - Phase 4**: Depends on US2 components existing (uses LearningObjectives and Prerequisites in template)
- **User Story 6 (P2) - Phase 5**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2) - Phase 6**: Can start after Foundational - Documentation only, no code dependencies
- **User Story 4 (P2) - Phase 7**: Can start after Foundational - Documentation only, no code dependencies
- **User Story 5 (P3) - Phase 8**: Can start after Foundational - Configuration only, no code dependencies

### Within Each User Story

- Component creation before registration
- Registration before testing
- CSS styles in parallel with components
- Documentation can happen in parallel with implementation
- Template updates after components are tested

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002, T003, T004)
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T006, T007, T009)
- Within US2: T010 and T011 can run in parallel (different components)
- Within US2: T013 and T014 can run in parallel (different CSS classes)
- Within US3: T034-T038 can all run in parallel (different documentation sections)
- Within US4: T041-T045 can all run in parallel (different callout types)
- Within Polish: T053, T058-T061, T064 can run in parallel (different files)
- US6, US3, US4, US5 can be worked on in parallel by different team members after US1+US2 complete

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch both component implementations together:
Task: "Create LearningObjectives component in src/components/LearningObjectives.tsx"
Task: "Create Prerequisites component in src/components/Prerequisites.tsx"

# Launch both CSS styling tasks together:
Task: "Add CSS styles for .learning-objectives class in src/css/custom.css"
Task: "Add CSS styles for .prerequisites class in src/css/custom.css"
```

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# These tasks can all start at the same time:
Task: "Add prebuild script to package.json to run validation"
Task: "Copy JSON Schema from specs/ to project root contracts/"
Task: "Add base CSS structure for custom components in src/css/custom.css"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 + Migration)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 2 (Learning Components)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 1 (Chapter Template)
5. **Complete Phase 9: Migration (CRITICAL)** - Apply components to existing chapters
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test creating a chapter from template AND verify existing chapters show new components
7. Deploy/demo if ready

**Rationale**: US1 and US2 provide infrastructure, but **migration makes it visible to readers**. Without migration, the upgrade appears incomplete. This is the true minimum viable product.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 2 → Test independently (components render)
3. Add User Story 1 → Test independently (template works)
4. **Add Migration → Apply to existing chapters → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)** ⚠️ CRITICAL
5. Add User Story 6 → Test independently (Key Takeaways) → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Stories 3, 4, 5 in parallel (documentation + config) → Deploy/Demo
7. Add Polish → Final release
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

**IMPORTANT**: Migration phase is when the upgrade becomes visible to end users. Infrastructure alone (US1+US2) is not sufficient for a deployable MVP.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (Learning Components)
   - Developer B: User Story 6 (Key Takeaways)
   - Developer C: User Stories 3 & 4 (Documentation)
3. Developer A then completes User Story 1 (needs US2 components)
4. Developer D: User Story 5 + Polish (ExerciseBlock, Style Guide)
5. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 79

**Tasks per User Story**:
- Setup: 4 tasks
- Foundational: 5 tasks (BLOCKING)
- User Story 2 (P1): 7 tasks - Display Learning Components
- User Story 1 (P1): 11 tasks - Create Chapter Template
- User Story 6 (P2): 6 tasks - Key Takeaways Component
- User Story 3 (P2): 7 tasks - Code Examples Standards
- User Story 4 (P2): 8 tasks - Callout Guidelines
- User Story 5 (P3): 4 tasks - Navigation Configuration
- **Migration: 10 tasks - Apply template system to existing 9 chapter files (CRITICAL)**
- Polish: 17 tasks - ExerciseBlock, Style Guide, Examples, Final Validation

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- 26 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase
- User Stories 3, 4, 5, 6 can be developed in parallel after foundational phase
- **All 8 migration tasks (T053-T060) can run in parallel - different files**

**Suggested MVP Scope**:
- Phases 1-4 + Migration (Setup + Foundational + US2 + US1 + Migration) = 37 tasks
- Delivers core value: standardized chapter template with learning components APPLIED to existing chapters
- Estimated: 2-3 days for single developer, 1-2 days with parallel execution
- **Migration phase is CRITICAL** - without it, readers still see old layout despite infrastructure being built

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Build validation (npm run build) should pass after each component is complete
- Manual testing involves creating test chapters in docs/test/ and verifying rendering
- No automated tests per specification - validation is via JSON Schema at build time
- All CSS must work in both light and dark modes
- All components must be SSR-compatible (no client-only blocking features)
