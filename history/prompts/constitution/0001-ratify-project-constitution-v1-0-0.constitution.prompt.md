## Prompt

User requested constitution recommendations for the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook project, which involves:
- Writing a book using Docusaurus and deploying to GitHub Pages
- Using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code for AI/Spec-driven development
- Creating educational content about humanoid robotics

User then requested running `/sp.constitution` to create the constitution file.

## Response snapshot

Created initial constitution v1.0.0 for the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Textbook project with six core principles:

1. **Content Accuracy & Technical Rigor**: All technical claims, formulas, code examples, and research must be accurate and verifiable with proper citations
2. **Educational Clarity & Accessibility**: Content must progress logically from fundamentals to advanced topics with clear learning pathways
3. **Consistency & Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Uniform terminology, formatting, and structure enforced via glossary and notation standards
4. **Docusaurus Structure & Quality**: Documentation must be navigable, searchable, and maintainable with proper metadata and organization
5. **Code Example Quality**: All code must be runnable, well-documented, pedagogically sound, and include safety warnings for hardware-interacting code
6. **Deployment & Publishing Standards**: Published content must build successfully, load quickly, and meet quality gates (performance, SEO, accessibility)

Added two key sections:
- **Content Development Workflow**: Spec-driven chapter creation process with artifacts and content types
- **Quality Gates & Review Process**: Pre-merge gates, review criteria, and review roles

Included sync impact report documenting this as an initial ratification with all templates verified as aligned.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established governance framework for AI-driven textbook development with clear quality standards for technical educational content
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests (constitution is a governance document)
- 📁 Files: Created `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (v1.0.0)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Consider creating first chapter spec using `/sp.specify`, or setting up Docusaurus project structure
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution appropriately tailored for educational content creation, emphasizing accuracy, accessibility, and deployment quality which are critical for a technical textbook

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (constitution ratification)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard constitution creation workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test constitution by creating a sample chapter spec to validate principles are actionable
