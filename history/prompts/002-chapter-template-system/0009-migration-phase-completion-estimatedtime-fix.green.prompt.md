## Prompt

Context continuation from previous session that ran out of context. User requested to continue from where work was left off. Previous session had completed T053-T056 (module index migrations) and started T057-T060 (intro and setup guide migrations). Build was succeeding but with broken link errors and estimatedTime validation warnings.

User's final interaction before context transfer: "you have completed?" - I indicated 50% progress and continued with remaining migrations.

## Response snapshot

Completed Phase 9 (Migration) tasks for feature 002-chapter-template-system:

1. **Migrated remaining files (T057-T060)**:
   - docs/intro.mdx: Added LearningObjectives component (no Prerequisites since it's intro page)
   - docs/setup/workstation.mdx: Added both LearningObjectives and Prerequisites components
   - docs/setup/edge-kit.mdx: Added both components
   - docs/setup/cloud.mdx: Added both components

2. **Fixed broken link cascades**:
   - Updated all module index references from `.md` to `.mdx`
   - Fixed cross-references between setup guides
   - Applied Docusaurus convention: removed `/index` suffix from links
   - Updated glossary.md references

3. **Fixed estimatedTime validation warnings**:
   - **Root cause**: Prerequisites component expects time in MINUTES (>= 5), but frontmatter had HOURS
   - **Fix**: Converted setup guide times to minutes:
     - workstation.mdx: 2 hours → 120 minutes
     - edge-kit.mdx: 3 hours → 180 minutes
     - cloud.mdx: 2 hours → 120 minutes
   - **Validation**: `npm run build` passed without Prerequisites warnings

4. **Updated tasks.md**:
   - Marked T057-T060 as completed [X]
   - All migration tasks now complete (T053-T061)

**Migration Pattern Applied**:
```mdx
---
title: "Chapter Title"
learning_objectives:
  - Objective 1
  - Objective 2
prerequisites: []
estimated_time: 120  # in minutes
---

import LearningObjectives from '@site/src/components/LearningObjectives';
import Prerequisites from '@site/src/components/Prerequisites';

# Chapter Title

<LearningObjectives objectives={frontMatter.learning_objectives} />
<Prerequisites prereqs={frontMatter.prerequisites} estimatedTime={frontMatter.estimated_time} />
```

**Build Result**: ✅ SUCCESS - no broken links, no component validation warnings

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Phase 9 (Migration) complete - book layout upgrade now visible to readers on intro page and all 3 setup guides (workstation, edge-kit, cloud)
- 🧪 Tests: npm run build passed without warnings (only deprecated config warning unrelated to our work)
- 📁 Files: 6 files modified (4 chapter migrations, 1 glossary link fix, 1 tasks.md update)
- 🔁 Next prompts: T062 (visual inspection - optional), Phase 10 (Polish) tasks, or new feature work
- 🧠 Reflection: Discovered unit mismatch between frontmatter (hours) and component expectation (minutes) - fixed by understanding Prerequisites.tsx validation logic

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: estimatedTime validation failure due to unit mismatch (hours vs minutes), cascading broken links from file renames
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Build validation PASS, component rendering validation pending (T062)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Context continuation without user questions - proceeded autonomously with last known task
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Visual inspection via dev server (T062), or proceed to Phase 10 Polish tasks
