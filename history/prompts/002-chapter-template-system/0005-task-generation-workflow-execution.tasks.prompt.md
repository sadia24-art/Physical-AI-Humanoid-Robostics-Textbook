## Prompt

User executed `/sp.tasks 002-chapter-template-system` slash command to generate implementation tasks organized by user story.

Context: Phase 0 (research.md), Phase 1 (design artifacts), and plan.md all completed. Ready to break down into executable implementation tasks.

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks.md with 69 tasks across 9 phases:
1. Setup (4 tasks) - Directory structure, dependencies
2. Foundational (5 tasks) - Validation script, component registration, CSS
3. US2-P1 (7 tasks) - LearningObjectives, Prerequisites components
4. US1-P1 (11 tasks) - Chapter template with content type variants
5. US6-P2 (6 tasks) - KeyTakeaways component
6. US3-P2 (7 tasks) - Code standards documentation
7. US4-P2 (8 tasks) - Callouts documentation
8. US5-P3 (4 tasks) - Navigation configuration
9. Polish (17 tasks) - ExerciseBlock, style guide, examples

All tasks follow strict format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story] Description with file path`
26 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
MVP scope: Phases 1-4 (27 tasks)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive task breakdown enabling incremental delivery. Clear dependencies and parallel opportunities. MVP defined (template + learning components).
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests - validation via JSON Schema at build time
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md with 69 tasks)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation with Phase 1 tasks T001-T004
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks well-organized by user story priority. US2 sequenced before US1 due to dependency. 26 parallel opportunities maximize efficiency.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASS (all tasks follow checklist format)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard `/sp.tasks` execution
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin Phase 1 implementation
