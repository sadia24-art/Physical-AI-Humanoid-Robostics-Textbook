## Prompt

User requested: "A" (proceed with creating `/sp.specify 002-chapter-template-system`)

Context: After completing book layout audit (`specs/001-book-master-plan/book-layout-audit.md`), user was presented with recommendations for 3 prioritized feature specs:
1. Priority 1: `002-chapter-template-system` (Chapter Template System) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
2. Priority 2: `003-learning-components` (Interactive Learning Components)
3. Priority 3: `004-visual-design-system` (Visual Design Polish)

The audit identified critical gaps:
- No chapter template for content authors (leading to inconsistent structure)
- No interactive learning components (quizzes, exercises, code playgrounds)
- Underutilization of Docusaurus features (admonitions, code enhancements, tabs)
- Manual navigation (no automatic prev/next links)

User chose Option A: "Proceed with spec" to create the highest priority specification for standardizing chapter structure across the 50+ chapter textbook.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Chapter Template System with:

**6 User Stories (Prioritized P1-P3)**:
1. P1: Create New Chapter from Template - Foundation for all content authoring
2. P1: Display Learning Components - Critical for self-paced learning
3. P2: Add Code Examples with Standards - Ensure code readability and consistency
4. P2: Use Callouts for Important Information - Improve comprehension
5. P3: Navigate Between Chapters - UX polish feature
6. P2: Summarize Key Takeaways - Reinforce learning

**17 Functional Requirements (FR-001 to FR-017)** covering:
- Chapter template structure and content type variants (Tutorial, Concept, Hands-on Lab, Reference)
- MDX components: Learning Objectives, Prerequisites, Estimated Time badge, Key Takeaways, Exercise Block
- Code block standards: syntax highlighting, line numbers, copy button, line highlighting, titles
- Callout guidelines: 5 types (note, tip, warning, danger, info) with usage guidance
- Navigation: automatic prev/next links with adjacent chapter titles
- Content style guide: Bloom's taxonomy verbs, voice/tone, code conventions

**10 Success Criteria (SC-001 to SC-010)** with measurable outcomes:
- Authors create chapters in <30 minutes (excluding writing)
- 100% metadata validation pass rate
- Consistent code formatting across all chapters
- Readers identify objectives/prerequisites within 5 seconds
- 90% of chapters use callouts for key information
- 100% navigation coverage (prev/next links)
- All chapters follow same structural order
- 40% reduction in chapter creation time (via author survey)
- Zero build failures from template usage
- Readers distinguish content types by structure

**Quality Validation**: All checklist items pass:
✅ No implementation details
✅ User-focused language
✅ All mandatory sections complete
✅ No clarifications needed (zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers)
✅ Testable and unambiguous requirements
✅ Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
✅ Comprehensive edge cases (7 scenarios)
✅ Clear scope boundaries (Out of Scope section)

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Four content type variants for different pedagogical purposes
- Reusable MDX components for consistency
- Docusaurus built-in features leveraged (admonitions, code enhancements, navigation)
- Template stored in `.specify/templates/chapter-template.md`
- Manual copy workflow (no automated scaffolding in MVP)
- Validation against existing JSON Schema (`chapter-metadata-schema.json`)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created production-ready specification for standardizing all 50+ chapters in the Physical AI textbook. Spec enables content authors to create consistent, high-quality chapters with learning objectives, prerequisites, code standards, callouts, and navigation. Foundation for Priority 2 (`003-learning-components`) and Priority 3 (`004-visual-design-system`) features.

- 🧪 Tests: Quality checklist validates: (1) No implementation details, (2) User-focused content, (3) All mandatory sections complete, (4) Zero clarifications needed, (5) Testable requirements, (6) Measurable success criteria, (7) Comprehensive edge cases, (8) Clear scope boundaries. All items PASS on first validation.

- 📁 Files: Created `specs/002-chapter-template-system/spec.md` (322 lines, 6 user stories, 17 FRs, 10 SCs) and `specs/002-chapter-template-system/checklists/requirements.md` (validation checklist).

- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.clarify 002-chapter-template-system` (if team review identifies ambiguities) OR `/sp.plan 002-chapter-template-system` (to design implementation approach: create template file, build MDX components, configure navigation, write style guide).

- 🧠 Reflection: Specification directly addresses audit findings (no template, inconsistent structure, underutilized Docusaurus features). User stories are independently testable, enabling incremental delivery. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. Assumptions document reasonable defaults (e.g., Docusaurus installed, MDX enabled, web browser access) to avoid unnecessary clarifications. Out of Scope section defers interactive features (quizzes, code playgrounds, video embeds) to `003-learning-components` spec.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Spec passed all quality checks on first iteration. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers added—all decisions made with informed defaults documented in Assumptions section.

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Content Quality: PASS (4/4 items)
  - Requirement Completeness: PASS (8/8 items)
  - Feature Readiness: PASS (4/4 items)
  - Overall: PASS

- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - First iteration

- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate that author survey (SC-008: 40% time reduction) is realistic by testing template with 2-3 sample chapters during implementation phase. If survey results differ significantly, adjust success criterion threshold.
