## Prompt

User executed `/sp.plan 002-chapter-template-system` slash command to continue the planning workflow.

Context: Previous work had already completed Phase 0 (research.md - 6 research questions answered) and Phase 1 (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md). The workflow required filling plan.md, performing constitution check, updating agent context, and creating PHR.

## Response snapshot

Executed full `/sp.plan` workflow:
1. Ran setup-plan.sh (copied template)
2. Read constitution (6 principles, identified Principle V deviation)
3. Created comprehensive plan.md (350 lines) with Technical Context, Constitution Check (PASS with 1 justified deviation), Phase 0/1 documentation (COMPLETED), Phase 2 outline (PENDING)
4. Updated agent context via update-agent-context.sh (added TypeScript, React, Docusaurus, MDX, AJV to CLAUDE.md)
5. Created and filled this PHR

Constitution Check: PASS with 1 documented deviation (Principle V - inline code examples for pedagogical continuity)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Executed complete `/sp.plan` workflow. Documented completed Phase 0 (Research) and Phase 1 (Design). Passed constitution check with justified deviation. Updated agent context.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run (planning phase)
- 📁 Files: 2 modified (plan.md, CLAUDE.md), 1 created (this PHR)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Execute `/sp.tasks 002-chapter-template-system` for Phase 2 implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning workflow executed successfully. All design artifacts properly documented. Ready for task generation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution check PASS (1 justified deviation)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard `/sp.plan` execution
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to `/sp.tasks`
