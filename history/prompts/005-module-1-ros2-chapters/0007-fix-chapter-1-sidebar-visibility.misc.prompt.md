## Prompt

/sp.analyze why chapter 1 is not showing in sidebar and does not link anywhere in book for module 1

## Response snapshot

**Root Cause Identified:**
Chapter 1 file exists at `docs/module-1-ros2/chapter-1-intro-ros2.mdx` but was missing from the sidebar configuration in `sidebars.js`.

**Analysis:**
- sidebars.js:35 showed Module 1 category only contained `'module-1-ros2/index'`
- Chapter 1 was never registered in the `items` array
- File was created during Phase 3 implementation but sidebar config was not updated

**Fix Applied:**
Updated sidebars.js to include Chapter 1 in Module 1 items array:

```javascript
items: [
  'module-1-ros2/index',
  'module-1-ros2/chapter-1-intro-ros2',  // Added
],
```

**Dev Server Status:**
Server running at http://localhost:3000/Physical-AI-Humanoid-Robotics-Textbook/ with webpack path resolution warnings (Windows/WSL path mismatch - non-blocking).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Chapter 1 now accessible from Module 1 sidebar navigation
- 🧪 Tests: Manual browser verification needed after hot reload
- 📁 Files: Modified sidebars.js (line 35-38)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Verify in browser, then continue with Chapters 2-5 implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Sidebar registration was missed during Chapter 1 creation - should be part of chapter creation checklist

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Sidebar configuration step omitted during chapter implementation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (configuration fix)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.analyze with user-reported issue
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add "Update sidebars.js" as explicit task in chapter creation workflow
