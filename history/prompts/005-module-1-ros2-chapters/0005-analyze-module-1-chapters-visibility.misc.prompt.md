## Prompt

why chapters are not their in module 1?

## Response snapshot

Performed cross-artifact analysis of spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md to identify why Module 1 chapters are not visible in the book.

**Root Cause Identified**:
1. **CRITICAL**: Sidebar position conflict - both `index.mdx` and `chapter-1-intro-ros2.mdx` have `sidebar_position: 1`
2. **Coverage Gap**: Only 1 of 5 planned chapters implemented (20% complete)

**Key Findings**:
- C1 (CRITICAL): Duplicate sidebar_position causing display issues
- G1 (HIGH): Chapters 2-5 not yet created
- G2-G3 (MEDIUM): Assessments and code examples pending

**Current State**:
- Phases 1-2 complete (infrastructure and components)
- Chapter 1 created with full content (15KB, all custom components working)
- 161 total tasks, ~16 completed (~10% overall progress)

**Recommendation**: Fix sidebar conflict in index.mdx (change to position 0), then continue creating chapters 2-5.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Identified critical sidebar configuration issue blocking chapter visibility
- 🧪 Tests: Verified file existence, analyzed front matter, checked tasks coverage
- 📁 Files: Analyzed 2 MDX files, cross-referenced with tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Fix sidebar position, continue chapter implementation (Phases 3-7)
- 🧠 Reflection: Analysis revealed implementation is on track but incomplete; no spec/plan issues, just execution progress at 10%

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - analysis correctly identified implementation gaps vs. specification issues
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (read-only analysis)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.analyze with user context question
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Fix sidebar_position: 0 in index.mdx, rebuild, verify chapter appears in sidebar
