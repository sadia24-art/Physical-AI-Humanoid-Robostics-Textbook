## Prompt

/sp.clarify specs/005-module-1-ros2-chapters/spec.md

User requested clarification of the Module 1 ROS 2 specification to reduce ambiguities and resolve open questions before planning phase.

## Response snapshot

**Clarification Session Completed: 5 Questions Asked and Answered**

Conducted systematic ambiguity scan across specification taxonomy and identified 5 high-impact clarification opportunities from 6 original open questions. All questions were answered with recommended options accepted.

**Questions and Answers:**

1. **Assessment format** → Individual practical assessment (not team-based) with timed coding challenges
2. **Code scaffolding** → Minimal scaffolding with TODO markers in skeleton files
3. **ROS 2 distribution** → Humble Hawksbill (LTS) exclusively for curriculum longevity
4. **IDE policy** → Recommend VS Code with ROS extensions, but allow alternatives
5. **Gazebo simulation** → Preview only in Chapter 4 (instructor-led demo, no student hands-on)

**Spec Updates Applied:**
- Created Clarifications section with Session 2025-12-02 recording all Q&A
- Updated Assumptions section with 3 new confirmed policies
- Modified 4 functional requirements (FR-008, FR-025, FR-026, FR-037) for clarity
- Added new FR-055 for Gazebo preview demo in Chapter 4
- Renumbered Chapter 5 requirements (FR-056 through FR-069)
- Updated Out of Scope section to clarify Gazebo exclusions
- Resolved 5 of 6 original Open Questions (1 remains: Hardware access timing)

**Coverage Analysis:**
- Functional Scope: Clear (detailed user stories, success criteria, edge cases)
- Data Model: Clear (13 key entities defined)
- UX Flow: Clear (18 acceptance scenarios across 5 user stories)
- Non-Functional: Clear (10 measurable success criteria, comprehensive risk analysis)
- Integration: Clear (dependencies and exclusions well-defined)
- Completion Signals: Clear (testable requirements, measurable outcomes)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Specification ambiguity significantly reduced from 6 open questions to 1. Critical pedagogical decisions (assessment format, scaffolding approach, distribution choice, IDE policy, simulation scope) now documented and integrated throughout spec. Ready for /sp.plan phase.
- 🧪 Tests: Incremental validation after each integration - no contradictions, no placeholder remnants, markdown structure intact
- 📁 Files: 1 file updated (spec.md) - 5 clarifications recorded, 8 sections modified (Clarifications, Assumptions, FR-008/025/026/037/055-069, Out of Scope, Open Questions)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to develop implementation strategy for Module 1 chapters
- 🧠 Reflection: Sequential questioning with immediate integration after each answer worked well - prevented accumulation of conflicts and ensured spec remained internally consistent. All recommendations accepted indicates strong pedagogical alignment. Remaining open question (hardware access) is infrastructure-dependent and appropriately deferred to planning phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. All 5 clarifications integrated successfully without conflicts or validation errors.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Spec validation (markdown structure): PASS. Internal consistency (no contradictions): PASS. Completeness (FR numbering sequential): PASS.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.clarify workflow with recommended options presented for each question
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider batch-presenting multiple clarification questions when they're truly independent (e.g., Q3 and Q4 could have been asked together) to accelerate workflow while maintaining integration quality.
