## Prompt

lets focus on writing module 1 chapters, here are content for all module, first do strong research only for module 1 chapters then write detailed specs for module 1 chapters   Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
Focus and Theme: AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.
Goal: Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Students apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.
Quarter Overview
The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.
Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Focus: Middleware for robot control.
ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services.
Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy.
Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids.

[Full user input with hardware requirements and course structure provided]

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Module 1 with:

**Research Phase**:
- Conducted web searches for ROS 2 Humble/Iron architecture, rclpy Python tutorials, and URDF best practices
- Retrieved official ROS 2 documentation from Context7 library (/ros2/ros2_documentation and /ros2/rclpy)
- Reviewed authoritative sources: docs.ros.org, roboticsbackend.com, NVIDIA developer blog

**Specification Structure** (340 lines):
- 5 prioritized user stories (P1-P5) covering: ROS 2 Architecture → Python Nodes → AI Integration → URDF → Launch Files
- 68 functional requirements organized across 5 chapters (FR-001 to FR-068)
- 13 key entities defined (Node, Topic, Message, Service, Action, etc.)
- 10 measurable success criteria with specific metrics (time, percentages, performance)
- 6 learning objectives aligned with course goals
- Comprehensive sections: Assumptions, Dependencies, Out of Scope, Risks & Mitigations, Open Questions

**Key Features**:
- Each user story independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios (18 total)
- Requirements focus on educational content delivery, not implementation
- Success criteria technology-agnostic and measurable (e.g., "within 10 minutes", "90% of students")
- Edge cases cover fault tolerance, high-frequency data, type safety, naming conflicts
- Risk mitigation for technical (Linux/installation), pedagogical (skill variation), and content challenges

**Validation**:
- Created quality checklist: all 14 validation items pass
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- No implementation details in spec (separates subject matter from authoring approach)
- Ready for /sp.plan phase

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete, validated specification for Module 1 chapters ready for planning phase. Provides clear roadmap for authoring 5 chapters covering ROS 2 fundamentals for humanoid robotics education.
- 🧪 Tests: Specification validation checklist completed with all 14 items passing (content quality, requirement completeness, feature readiness)
- 📁 Files: 2 files created (spec.md: 340 lines with 68 functional requirements; checklists/requirements.md: validation results)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to develop implementation strategy, or /sp.clarify if stakeholders need to resolve open questions (6 identified)
- 🧠 Reflection: Strong research phase (ROS 2 docs, Context7 library, web sources) provided authoritative foundation. Priority system (P1-P5) enables flexible delivery. Educational focus maintained throughout - spec describes what students learn, not how to author content.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Workflow executed successfully: research → generate branch → write spec → validate quality → create PHR.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification quality checklist: PASS (14/14 items). Requirements testability: PASS. Success criteria measurability: PASS.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow with enhanced research phase (3 web searches + 2 Context7 library queries)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider creating chapter-level specifications in addition to module-level for more granular planning. Current approach provides good balance between detail and manageability.
