## Prompt

User executed `/sp.tasks` command to generate granular implementation tasks for feature 005-module-1-ros2-chapters.

**Context**: Following the specification (0001), clarification (0002), and planning (0003) sessions, user requested task breakdown for Module 1: "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" educational content.

**Available Design Documents**:
- plan.md (tech stack, project structure, constitution check)
- spec.md (5 user stories with priorities P1-P5, 69 functional requirements)
- research.md (content sources, diagram requirements, code infrastructure, components, assessments)
- data-model.md (content hierarchy, JSON schemas, file naming conventions)
- quickstart.md (authoring guide, workflow, conventions)
- contracts/ (5 component specifications: CodeExample, ExerciseBlock, ConceptCallout, AssessmentChecklist, ROSVersionBadge)

**User Stories from spec.md**:
1. US1 (P1): Understanding ROS 2 Architecture and Core Concepts → Chapter 1
2. US2 (P2): Building ROS 2 Nodes with Python (rclpy) → Chapter 2
3. US3 (P3): Bridging Python AI Agents to ROS 2 Controllers → Chapter 3
4. US4 (P4): Understanding URDF for Humanoid Robot Description → Chapter 4
5. US5 (P5): Working with Launch Files and Package Management → Chapter 5

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks.md file with 161 tasks organized into 8 phases:

**Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks)**
- JSON Schema creation, directory structure, code templates, validation scripts

**Phase 2: Foundational (11 tasks)**
- Custom MDX components: CodeExample, ExerciseBlock, ConceptCallout, AssessmentChecklist
- Component styling, registration, unit testing
- Critical path blocker: Components must be complete before chapter authoring

**Phase 3-7: User Stories (123 tasks total)**
- Each user story maps to one chapter (US1→Chapter 1, US2→Chapter 2, etc.)
- Per-chapter tasks: Content creation (4-5 sections), Diagrams (3-4 diagrams), Code examples (4-7 examples with skeleton/complete versions), Exercises (2 per chapter), Assessments (1 per chapter), Validation (3-4 tasks)

**Phase 8: Polish (22 tasks)**
- Module integration, diagram finalization, code standardization, accessibility checks, build validation, documentation

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Tasks organized by user story for independent implementation and testing
- Each chapter phase is independently testable (students can verify learning)
- ~80 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution (50% parallelization)
- No automated tests for content (manual review + Docusaurus build validation)
- MVP scope: Phases 1-3 (33 tasks, US1/Chapter 1 complete)

**Dependency Structure**:
- Critical path: Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → US3 → US5
- Independent: US4 (URDF) can parallel with US2/US3
- Recommended sequence prioritizes foundational concepts first

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: 161 granular, executable tasks generated. Each task has exact file path, clear description, and appropriate labels ([P] for parallel, [US#] for user story mapping). Tasks enable independent chapter authoring and parallel execution.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests for educational content. Validation strategy: npm run validate-metadata (front matter), npm run build (MDX syntax), manual review (accessibility, tone, conventions).
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md, 561 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts:
  1. Review tasks.md and approve task breakdown
  2. Run `/sp.implement 005-module-1-ros2-chapters` to begin implementation
  3. Start with MVP scope (Phases 1-3, 33 tasks) for fastest value delivery
- 🧠 Reflection: Task generation successfully mapped 5 user stories to 5 chapters with comprehensive breakdown. Each chapter phase includes content, diagrams, code examples, exercises, and assessments. Parallelization opportunities identified (50% of tasks). MVP scope clearly defined. Ready for implementation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Task generation completed successfully with proper organization by user story.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All tasks follow checklist format (checkbox, ID, [P]/[Story] labels, file paths). Dependencies clearly documented. Parallel execution examples provided.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow with user story-based organization
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - Task generation complete. Next experiment will be in implementation phase to validate task granularity and time estimates (plan.md estimates 90-120 hours total).
