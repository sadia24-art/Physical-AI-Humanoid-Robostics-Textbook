## Prompt

User requested: "Please makesure we have context7 mcp, their you can access docusorus docs, you can use /sp.clarify command"

Context: User wants to leverage Context7 MCP to access Docusaurus documentation and refine the book master plan spec with Docusaurus-specific clarifications.

Command executed: `/sp.clarify book-master-plan`

Note: Context7 MCP tools were not available in the tool list, so clarifications proceeded based on Docusaurus best practices from knowledge base.

## Response snapshot

Conducted interactive clarification session with 5 questions addressing critical Docusaurus-specific decisions:

**Q1: Sidebar Organization Pattern**
- User selected: Option D - Single sidebar with nested collapsible categories with cross-references
- Impact: Updated FR-008 to specify nested collapsible structure organized by modules

**Q2: Chapter Metadata Requirements**
- User selected: Option D - Custom metadata with assessment tracking (estimated_time, week, module, prerequisites, learning_objectives, sidebar_label, assessment_type, difficulty_level, capstone_component)
- Impact: Updated FR-011 and Chapter entity definition with 9 metadata fields

**Q3: Homepage Layout**
- User selected: Option D - Dashboard-style with module cards + quick links sidebar + recent updates
- Impact: Added FR-013, updated User Story 1 acceptance scenario

**Q4: Search Functionality**
- User selected: Option C - Hybrid approach (Algolia DocSearch + dedicated glossary component)
- Impact: Added FR-007a, updated SC-007 and User Story 2 for instant glossary lookup

**Q5: Code Example Repository Structure**
- User selected: Option D - Embedded code snippets only, no separate repository
- Impact: Updated Scope Boundaries, added Constitution Compliance Notes section documenting deviation from Principle V with justification

All clarifications integrated incrementally after each answer.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Resolved all critical Docusaurus architecture ambiguities. Spec now has concrete decisions for navigation, metadata, homepage, search, and code examples. Ready for planning phase with clear technical requirements.
- 🧪 Tests: Coverage taxonomy validation complete - 10/10 categories resolved or clear (no outstanding ambiguities)
- 📁 Files: Updated spec.md with Clarifications section (5 Q&A), 3 new/updated functional requirements (FR-007a, FR-011, FR-013), Constitution Compliance Notes section
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan book-master-plan` to design Docusaurus implementation (sidebar config, metadata schema, homepage components, search integration)
- 🧠 Reflection: Dashboard-style homepage and hybrid search add complexity but deliver best UX for practitioners. Embedded code approach simplifies maintenance but requires documented deviation from constitution. All decisions traceable in Clarifications section.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Context7 MCP unavailable (proceeded with knowledge-based recommendations)
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Coverage taxonomy check - PASS (all categories resolved/clear)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard clarification workflow with Docusaurus-specific questions
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test if Constitution Compliance Notes section pattern works for other specs with principle deviations
