## Prompt

User requested: "please proceed" (to continue with task generation after completing Phase 1 design artifacts)

Context: User approved proceeding with `/sp.tasks book-master-plan` command. All design documents were complete:
- plan.md (520 lines with tech stack, project structure, Phase 0 research, Phase 1 design)
- spec.md (255 lines with 5 user stories, 13 functional requirements, 10 success criteria)
- research.md (technology decisions for Docusaurus, Algolia, Flexsearch, build pipeline)
- data-model.md (5 entities: Module, Chapter, Glossary Entry, Hardware Configuration, Assessment)
- contracts/chapter-metadata-schema.json (JSON Schema for frontmatter validation)
- contracts/sidebar-config-structure.ts (TypeScript types)
- quickstart.md (developer setup guide)

Command executed: `/sp.tasks book-master-plan`

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks.md with 76 implementation tasks organized into 8 phases:

**Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks)** - Docusaurus initialization, TypeScript config, project structure
**Phase 2: Foundational (12 tasks)** - Core infrastructure blocking all user stories (docusaurus.config.js, sidebars.js, directory structure, metadata validation, CI/CD pipelines)
**Phase 3: User Story 1 - P1 (13 tasks)** - Navigate Complete Course Structure (dashboard homepage, module cards, quick links, recent updates, sidebar config, module index pages)
**Phase 4: User Story 2 - P1 (9 tasks)** - Access Foundational Setup Documentation (3 hardware setup guides, glossary with 100+ terms, glossary search component, Algolia configuration)
**Phase 5: User Story 3 - P2 (8 tasks)** - Follow Module-Based Learning Path (capstone integration sections, autonomous humanoid guide, time estimates, learning pathway diagram)
**Phase 6: User Story 4 - P2 (7 tasks)** - Access Assessment and Project Guidelines (4 assessment guides with 3-level rubrics, self-assessment checklists)
**Phase 7: User Story 5 - P3 (7 tasks)** - Reference Quick Guides and Troubleshooting (ROS 2 quick ref, notation guide, troubleshooting guide, instructors guide)
**Phase 8: Polish (15 tasks)** - Cross-cutting concerns (README, SEO, navbar, footer, placeholder chapters, image optimization, build validation, link checking, Lighthouse CI, incremental publishing test)

**Key Features**:
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- 29 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution across different files
- Clear MVP scope identified: Phase 1+2+3+4 (39 tasks for US1+US2)
- Dependencies section shows US1 and US2 can run in parallel (both P1)
- Success criteria mapping shows all 10 SCs satisfied by specific tasks
- Parallel execution examples provided for each major phase

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated immediately executable task breakdown with 76 tasks organized by user story. Each task has exact file paths, clear IDs, parallelism markers, and story labels. MVP scope identified (US1+US2 = dashboard navigation + setup guides + glossary). All tasks validate against strict checklist format. No circular dependencies detected.
- 🧪 Tests: Format validation PASS (76/76 tasks follow checklist format), Dependency graph PASS (no cycles), Success criteria mapping PASS (10/10 SCs mapped to tasks)
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md (520 lines, 76 tasks, 8 phases, dependency graphs, parallel execution examples, implementation strategies)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` to start Phase 1 implementation, or manually implement tasks in order (T001 → T076)
- 🧠 Reflection: Organizing tasks by user story (not by layer/tech stack) enabled true independent implementation and testing. US1 and US2 can ship as MVP without touching US3-US5. Marking [P] tasks explicitly (29/76) clarifies parallel opportunities. Critical insight: Foundational phase (12 tasks) BLOCKS all user stories - must complete first.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - workflow completed successfully with all validations passing
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASS (all 76 tasks follow `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description` pattern), Dependency validation PASS (no circular dependencies, clear phase order), Success criteria mapping PASS (all 10 SCs from spec.md mapped to specific tasks)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard `/sp.tasks` workflow with user story organization (not layered/tech stack organization)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test if explicitly showing "Parallel Example" sections for each user story (not just US1/US2) improves implementation clarity. Consider adding estimated time per task (in addition to phase-level estimates) to enable better sprint planning.
