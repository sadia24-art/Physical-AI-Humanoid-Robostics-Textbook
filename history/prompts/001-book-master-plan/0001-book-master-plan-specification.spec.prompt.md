## Prompt

User requested: "first we should write book plan, like chapters, parts, structure, and docusaurus project setup and set book layout, design"

Context provided:
- 13-week Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course for industry practitioners
- Target audience: Industry practitioners with programming knowledge (Python)
- Comprehensive textbook using Docusaurus + GitHub Pages
- Hardware-agnostic approach with Python + ROS 2 + Isaac Sim
- 4 modules: ROS 2 (Weeks 3-5), Digital Twin (Weeks 6-7), NVIDIA Isaac (Weeks 8-10), VLA & Humanoids (Weeks 11-13)
- Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI
- Capstone project: Autonomous humanoid (voice → plan → navigate → perceive → manipulate)
- 3 hardware options: Digital Twin Workstation, Physical AI Edge Kit, Cloud-Native Setup

Command executed: `/sp.specify book-master-plan`

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive book master plan specification with:

**5 User Stories** (prioritized P1-P3):
1. P1: Navigate Complete Course Structure - Students see 13-week structure with modules and prerequisites
2. P1: Access Foundational Setup Documentation - Hardware setup guides for 3 configurations
3. P2: Follow Module-Based Learning Path - Sequential module progression with capstone integration
4. P2: Access Assessment and Project Guidelines - 4 assessment rubrics and capstone architecture
5. P3: Reference Quick Guides and Troubleshooting - ROS 2 commands, troubleshooting, notation guides

**12 Functional Requirements**:
- FR-001 to FR-004: Module organization (4 modules + intro section)
- FR-005 to FR-007: Capstone guide, assessments, reference materials
- FR-008 to FR-012: Navigation structure, prerequisites, incremental delivery, time estimates, instructor guide

**6 Key Entities**: Module, Chapter, Part, Hardware Configuration, Assessment, Reference Material

**10 Success Criteria**: Navigation efficiency (2 clicks), link integrity (95%), learning outcome alignment, hardware documentation completeness, capstone mapping (5 minutes), time estimates, glossary (100+ terms), rubric levels (3+), independent publishing, customization support

**Scope Boundaries**: In scope (structure, navigation, setup docs, assessments, references) vs. Out of scope (actual content, code examples, multimedia, grading systems, LMS integration)

**Validation**: All specification quality checklist items passed - ready for planning phase

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established complete textbook structure blueprint aligned with 13-week course syllabus, enabling parallel development of modules and phased content rollout
- 🧪 Tests: Specification quality checklist validated (Content Quality ✓, Requirement Completeness ✓, Feature Readiness ✓)
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md (231 lines) and requirements checklist with all validation items passing
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan book-master-plan` to design Docusaurus structure, navigation system, and chapter organization
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec successfully separates structure (this spec) from content (future specs per chapter/module), enabling modular development. Clear prerequisite chains and phased rollout strategy support incremental delivery.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all validation passed on first iteration
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification Quality Checklist - PASS (all 12 criteria met)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard spec workflow with course syllabus context
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test if Docusaurus setup spec can reference this book structure spec for navigation requirements
