## Prompt

User requested: "yes please" (to proceed with `/sp.plan book-master-plan`)

Context: User approved proceeding with implementation planning after completing specification and clarifications. The spec had 5 user stories (P1-P3), 13 functional requirements, 10 success criteria, and documented architectural decisions from clarification session (dashboard homepage, hybrid search, nested sidebar, custom metadata, embedded code snippets).

Command executed: `/sp.plan book-master-plan`

## Response snapshot

Executed complete `/sp.plan` workflow with two phases:

**Phase 0 (Research)**:
- Created `research.md` documenting all technology decisions:
  - Docusaurus 3 best practices (sidebar config, custom homepage, TypeScript, metadata extraction, incremental publishing)
  - Search integration (Algolia DocSearch with custom facets, Flexsearch for glossary)
  - Dashboard homepage patterns (CSS Grid, module cards, quick links, recent updates)
  - Chapter metadata schema (JSON Schema validation with ajv)
  - Build pipeline (GitHub Actions, linkinator, Lighthouse CI, image optimization)

**Phase 1 (Design)**:
- Created `data-model.md` with 5 entity definitions (Module, Chapter, Glossary Entry, Hardware Configuration, Assessment)
- Created `contracts/chapter-metadata-schema.json` with JSON Schema for validating 9 required + 3 optional frontmatter fields
- Created `contracts/sidebar-config-structure.ts` with TypeScript type definitions and example configuration
- Created `quickstart.md` with developer setup guide (prerequisites, installation, dev server, build/deploy, chapter creation, quality checks, troubleshooting)

**Plan Structure**:
- Technical Context (TypeScript 5.x, Docusaurus 3.x, React 18.x, Algolia, Node.js 18+)
- Constitution Check (all 6 principles verified, 1 documented deviation for embedded code snippets)
- Project Structure (detailed Docusaurus directory layout with 7 modules, custom React components)
- Complexity Tracking (justified deviation from Constitution Principle V)
- Success Criteria Mapping (10 SCs mapped to design elements)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated comprehensive implementation plan with complete research documentation, entity models, JSON Schema contracts, TypeScript types, and developer quickstart. All Phase 0 and Phase 1 artifacts complete. Ready for `/sp.tasks` command to generate implementation breakdown.
- 🧪 Tests: Plan validation PASS (all sections complete), Constitution check PASS (6/6 principles verified with 1 documented deviation)
- 📁 Files: Created 6 files totaling ~1200 lines of planning artifacts (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, chapter-metadata-schema.json, sidebar-config-structure.ts, quickstart.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.tasks book-master-plan` to generate implementation tasks organized by user story priority
- 🧠 Reflection: Phase-based planning (Research → Design) enabled comprehensive Docusaurus architecture without premature implementation commitments. Separating technology research from entity design created clear decision trail from "what's available" to "what we'll use" to "how we'll structure it."

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - workflow completed successfully with all artifacts generated
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Plan validation - PASS (all sections present), Constitution check - PASS (6/6 principles verified, 1 deviation documented in spec)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard `/sp.plan` workflow with Phase 0 (Research) and Phase 1 (Design) separation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test if Phase 0/Phase 1 separation pattern works well for other complex features with external dependencies (frameworks, APIs, third-party services). Consider adding Phase 0.5 for "spike/prototype" when technology decisions need validation before full design.
