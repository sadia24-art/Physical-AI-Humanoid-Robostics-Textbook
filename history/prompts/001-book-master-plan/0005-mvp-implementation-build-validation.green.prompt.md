## Prompt

"please proceed"

(Continuation from previous session where planning phase completed and implementation was ready to begin)

## Response snapshot

Completed MVP implementation for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook:

**User Story 1: Navigate Complete Course Structure** ✅
- Created Module 2-4 index pages (module-2-digital-twin, module-3-isaac, module-4-vla-humanoids)
- Updated sidebars.js with all modules and references
- Added cross-references between modules

**User Story 2: Access Foundational Setup Documentation** ✅
- Created 3 hardware setup guides:
  - Workstation Setup (RTX GPU, Ubuntu 22.04, ROS 2, Isaac Sim) - $600-$2,500
  - Edge Kit Setup (Jetson Orin Nano, JetPack 6.0, ARM64 ROS 2) - $550
  - Cloud Setup (AWS g4dn.xlarge, Azure NC6s_v3, VNC remote desktop) - $90-$250
- Created searchable glossary with 78 robotics terms (ROS 2, simulation, Isaac Sim, VLA, humanoids)
- Built GlossarySearch component using Flexsearch (forward tokenization, resolution 9)
- Generated glossary index JSON for client-side search

**Build Validation & Debugging** ✅
- Fixed empty sidebar categories (removed Capstone Project and Assessments placeholders)
- Removed 25+ broken links to non-existent files (assessments, troubleshooting, ros2-quick-ref, capstone, week-specific pages)
- Fixed package.json: removed "type": "module" causing webpack/CommonJS conflicts
- Fixed Prism configuration: removed unsupported 'xml' language
- Updated QuickLinks component: replaced broken links with valid module links
- Updated docusaurus.config.js footer: removed broken resource links
- Final build: SUCCESS with 0 errors

**Generated Files:**
- 7 documentation pages (modules, setup guides, glossary)
- 2 React components updated (GlossarySearch, QuickLinks)
- 1 JSON index (glossary-index.json)
- Modified 4 config files (sidebars.js, docusaurus.config.js, package.json, intro.md + module pages)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: MVP is functionally complete and builds successfully. User Stories 1 AND 2 are fully implemented with 0 build errors.
- 🧪 Tests: npm run build passed with SUCCESS message. Generated static files in "build/" directory.
- 📁 Files: Created/modified 15 files across docs, components, and configuration.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Optional User Stories 3-5 (week-specific content, assessments, capstone), or move to deployment/testing phase.
- 🧠 Reflection: Encountered multiple build errors (empty sidebars, broken links, package.json ES modules conflict, Prism XML issue) but systematically resolved each. The iterative debugging process (8 build attempts) ensured a clean, working MVP.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed:
  1. Empty sidebar categories cause build failure (need at least one item or a link)
  2. "type": "module" in package.json conflicts with Docusaurus CommonJS config files
  3. Prism 'xml' language not supported in prism-react-renderer 2.4.0
  4. Broken links in footer/QuickLinks propagate to all pages and fail build
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - npm install: PASS (1529 packages, 6 minutes)
  - npm run generate-glossary-index: PASS (78 terms indexed)
  - npm run build: PASS (static files generated in build/)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (direct continuation from planning session)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add week-specific content pages (Week 3-13) OR implement GitHub Actions deployment workflow to validate CI/CD pipeline
