## Prompt

We have upgrade book layout, but actually it is not updated please analyze

## Response snapshot

Analyzed the book layout upgrade implementation status for Feature 002-chapter-template-system. Found that while the infrastructure (templates, components, CSS) has been implemented, the actual chapter content has NOT been updated to use the new template system.

**Critical Findings**:
- ✅ Templates created: 4 content type templates in docs/_templates/
- ✅ Components implemented: LearningObjectives, Prerequisites (2/4 complete)
- ✅ CSS styling: Complete styling for all components with dark mode
- ❌ Zero existing chapters migrated: Module index pages still use old manual format
- ❌ Missing components: KeyTakeaways and ExerciseBlock not implemented
- ❌ Navigation not configured: No automatic prev/next links
- ❌ Content gap: Only 9 files exist vs 50-60 recommended individual chapters

**Coverage**: 45% of functional requirements met (9/20)

**Root Cause**: Feature 002 focused on creating the system (templates, components) but did not include applying the system to existing content or creating the missing chapter content.

**User Impact**: Readers see the OLD chapter format, not the improved layout promised in the specification.

**Recommendations**:
1. Implement missing KeyTakeaways and ExerciseBlock components (3-4 hours)
2. Migrate all 9 existing files to use new components (2-3 hours)
3. Configure automatic navigation (1 hour)
4. Create remaining 41-51 individual chapter files (40-60 hours content authoring)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Identified critical implementation gap - infrastructure built but not applied to actual chapters
- 🧪 Tests: Manual verification via grep, file inspection, and build analysis
- 📁 Files: Analyzed 7 key files across templates, components, and specifications
- 🔁 Next prompts: Complete missing components, migrate existing chapters, or create new chapter content
- 🧠 Reflection: Gap between "system created" vs "system applied" - future features should explicitly include migration/adoption phase

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Feature implementation stopped at infrastructure creation without content migration; specification did not explicitly call out migration as deliverable
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual analysis PASS - identified gaps accurately
- Prompt variant (if applicable): /sp.analyze (read-only analysis mode)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Migrate one module index page to validate component integration before full migration
